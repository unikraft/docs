Unikraft is still in development phase; [not all security features have been
implemented](https://unikraft.org/docs/features/security/). Nevertheless, the
Unikraft project welcomes security vulnerability reports.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you have found a security vulnerability in Unikraft, we invite you to send
an e-mail to security@unikraft.org. Please do not disclose the vulnerability
before coordinating with us; we will work together to determine a suitable
disclosure timeframe.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow the principles of responsible disclosure. This means:

- Users first: we will work together with you to establish a suitable disclosure
  timeframe for the vulnerability. We will treat security reports as a priority.
- Transparency: after at most 90 days, security vulnerabilities will be
  transparently published to the community on our [security disclosure page](TODO LINK).

## Security Disclosure Q&A

### Should I request a CVE number for my vulnerability?

Please do not request a CVE number without coordinating with us. In general we
do not request CVE numbers *yet* as Unikraft is still in early development
phases when it comes to security and defensive features.

### Does the Unikraft project award bounties?

As a community-driven project, we do not award bounties for vulnerability
reports; however we will mention your name in our [security disclosure page](TODO LINK).

### Where are security fixes released?

We release security fixes to the Unikraft staging branch, which regularly
transitions to stable. As Unikraft is still in development stages, we do not
backport security fixes to older Unikraft releases. However, we maintain a list
of disclosed vulnerabilities along with corresponding fix(es) on our
[security disclosure page](TODO LINK).
