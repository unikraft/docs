### Deploying Cloud Applications using Unikraft Cloud

If you did not create an account already, signup [here](https://console.unikraft.cloud/signup) and get a `token`.
You will be using that in the following sessions.

Once you have a token, follow the steps [here](https://unikraft.cloud/docs/quickstart/) to deploy your first unikernel.
If everything went well, deploy more applications following the tasks [here](TODO).

### Behind the Scenes: Using KraftKit to Operate Unikraft Applications

In the previous session, you deployed application using Unikraft Cloud.
Now you will build and run Unikraft-based application locally.
With this, you will get a better look at what `kraft cloud` does behind the scenes.

Follow the steps [here](https://unikraft.org/guides/using-the-app-catalog) and bring the cloud to your machine.
After you are done with all of them, take a look to some more applications, following the tasks [here](TODO).
Go through them orderly and aim to complete all items until the `Extra` section.
If you have extra time on your hands, go through the `Extra` section as well.

### Using Docker and Docker-based Filesystems

In order to bring your own application on Unikraft Cloud, you need to build a minimal required filesystem.
We do that using `docker`.
This is useful both to understand what is happening behind the scenes and to have a test environment for your application.
In case there are issues with Unikraft Cloud / KraftKit, you can use Docker to see if everything is in the right place and to assist in debugging.

Follow the steps [here](TODO) (only the ones under `Redis`) to see how you can port a new application on top of Unikraft.
Mark the items as completed [here](TODO).
Go through them orderly and aim to complete all items until the `Extra` section.
If you have extra time on your hands, go through the `Extra` section as well.

### Debugging Unikraft / Unikraft Cloud Applications

When porting new applications, you can run into issues both on the Docker build and on the Unikraft runtime.
To debug the issues, you can follow the instructions [here](https://unikraft.cloud/docs/guides/features/debugging/).
Get a hands-on experience with debugging by following the items [here](TODO).

### First Principles Approach: Using Make and VMMs Directly

Sometimes, if you want to go even further, you may need total control of the config, build or run steps.
You may want to add certain steps to the building/linking of the application, use a very different running environment, etc.
To do this, you can invoke the `make` command manually, and use `qemu` or `firecracker` to run the application.

In order to simplify these steps, we created scripts that run the required commands.
Follow the steps below to use the scripts.

* Clone the [`catalog-core`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/) repository.
* Move to the `scripts` branch (`git checkout scripts`).
* Choose 3 applications from the ones available.
* Enter the application directory (e.g. `cd c-hello/`).
* Run the scripts, build and run each application, for multiple architectures/VMMs (e.g. run `./build.qemu.x86_64` and `./run.qemu.x86_64`, then `./build.qemu.arm64` and `./run.qemu.arm64`).

You can find more instructions on using the scripts in the `README.scripts.md` file of each application directory.

After doing that, it's time to run the commands one by one, without using the scripts.
Switch bach to the `main` branch, enter the directories for the same applications you used before, and follow the instructions in the `REAMDE.md` file.
You can find a summary of the commands in the `Quick Setup (aka TLDR)` section of the `README`.
For every step, there is a section in the `README` file that goes into detail about the commands.

### Hackathon

For the hackathon, please create teams of 2-3 people, and create your very own cloud-native application to run on Unikraft Cloud.
Think of a cool application you've been waiting for a while to implement.
Use your preferred programming language (supported by Unikraft Cloud), employ any frameworks or existing software components as required, and then deploy it on Unikraft Cloud.
After you create a team and decide on a project, fill [this spreadsheet](TODO) with the team name, members and project idea.

At the and of the hackathon, you should make a PR in the [Unikraft Cloud `examples` repository](https://github.com/unikraft-cloud/examples) with your work.
We will be evaluating the project, focusing on functionality, originality, robustness, complexity, code quality and team work.
