### Deploying Cloud Applications using Unikraft Cloud

If you did not create an account already, signup [here](https://console.unikraft.cloud/signup) and get a `token`.
You will be using that in the following sessions.

Once you have a token, follow the steps [here](https://unikraft.cloud/docs/quickstart/) to deploy your first unikernel.
If everything went well, deploy more applications following the tasks [here](TODO).

### Behind the Scenes: Using KraftKit to Operate Unikraft Applications

In the previous session, you deployed application using Unikraft Cloud.
Now you will build and run Unikraft-based application locally.
With this, you will get a better look at what `kraft cloud` does behind the scenes.

Follow the steps [here](https://unikraft.org/guides/using-the-app-catalog) and bring the cloud to your machine.
After you are done with all of them, take a look to some more applications, following the tasks [here](TODO).
Go through them orderly and aim to complete all items until the `Extra` section.
If you have extra time on your hands, go through the `Extra` section as well.

### Using Docker and Docker-based Filesystems

In order to bring your own application on Unikraft Cloud, you need to build a minimal required filesystem.
We do that using `docker`.
This is useful both to understand what is happening behind the scenes and to have a test environment for your application.
In case there are issues with Unikraft Cloud / KraftKit, you can use Docker to see if everything is in the right place and to assist in debugging.

Follow the steps [here](TODO) (only the ones under `Redis`) to see how you can port a new application on top of Unikraft.
Mark the items as completed [here](TODO).
Go through them orderly and aim to complete all items until the `Extra` section.
If you have extra time on your hands, go through the `Extra` section as well.

### Debugging Unikraft / Unikraft Cloud Applications

When porting new applications, you can run into issues both on the Docker build and on the Unikraft runtime.
To debug the issues, you can follow the instructions [here](https://unikraft.cloud/docs/guides/features/debugging/).
Get a hands-on experience with debugging by following the items [here](TODO).

### Hackathon

For the hackathon, please create teams of 2-3 people, and create your very own cloud-native application to run on Unikraft Cloud.
Think of a cool application you've been waiting for a while to implement.
Use your preferred programming language (supported by Unikraft Cloud), employ any frameworks or existing software components as required, and then deploy it on Unikraft Cloud.
After you create a team and decide on a project, fill [this spreadsheet](TODO) with the team name, members and project idea.

At the and of the hackathon, you should make a PR in the [Unikraft Cloud `examples` repository](https://github.com/unikraft-cloud/examples) with your work.
We will be evaluating the project, focusing on functionality, originality, robustness, complexity, code quality and team work.
