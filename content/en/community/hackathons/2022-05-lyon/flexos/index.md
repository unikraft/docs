[FlexOS](https://github.com/project-flexos/) is an OS allowing users to easily specialize the safety and isolation strategy of an OS at compilation/deployment time, instead of design time. Depending on the configuration, the same FlexOS code can mimic a microkernel with multiple address-spaces, a single-address-space OS with Intel MPK compartments, or many other OS isolation approaches.

This talk gives an overview of FlexOS and the research prospects of unikernels and isolation.
