Unikraft is a Unikernel Development Kit and consists of an extensive build system in addition to core and external library ecosystem which facilitate the underlying functionality of a unikernel.
It is built as an open-source project and does so in the context of a vibrant community consisting of highly skilled software engineers, researchers, teachers, students and hobbyists.
As a community, its outreach consists of over 50 active contributors, 12 peer-reviewed academic publications, in 10 institutes, in 6 countries.

This talk will cover a breif introduction to Unikraft and then lead into 'Getting Started with Unikraft'.
