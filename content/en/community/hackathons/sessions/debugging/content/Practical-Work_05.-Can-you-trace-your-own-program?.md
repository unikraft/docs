Modify your `Echo-back Server` application implemented in the [first](https://usoc21.unikraft.org/docs/sessions/01-baby-steps/#01-echo-back-server) session so that each time the server responds with a message a tracepoint with the corresponding message will be activated.
Save all your tracepoints in a `traces.dat` file and show them in a user-friendly view with `trace.py`.
