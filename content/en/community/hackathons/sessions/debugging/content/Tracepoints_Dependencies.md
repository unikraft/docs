We provide some tools to read and export trace data that were collected with Unikraft's tracepoint system.
The tools depend on Python3, as well as the click and tabulate modules.
You can install them by running (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-click python3-tabulate
```
