We want to build the [`helloworld` application](https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld), using the Kconfig-based system, for the **linuxu** and **KVM** platforms, for the **ARM** and **x86** architectures, and then run them.

It is recommended that for building and developing applications and Unikraft, you create a conventional folder structure:

```
.
|-- apps/
|-- libs/
`-- unikraft/
```

That is a hierarchy with:

* `unikraft/` as the clone of the [`unikraft` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft)
* `apps/` storing folders for applications
* `libs/` storing folders for libraries

You would usually only have a single such hierarchy and add applications and / or libraries in their respective folders and use a single clone of the [`unikraft` repository].
We create this hierarchy, if not having it created already, by using the commands:

```console
$ mkdir workdir

$ cd workdir/

$ mkdir apps libs

$ git clone https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft
[...]

$ tree --charset=ascii -L 1
.
|-- apps
|-- libs
`-- unikraft
```

We want to work on the [`helloworld` application](https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld) so we clone in in the `apps/` subfolder.

```console
$ cd apps
$ git clone https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld helloworld
```

In the `apps/helloworld/` folder, make sure that `UK_ROOT` and `UK_LIBS` are set correctly in the `Makefile` file, i.e. to point to the location of the [`unikraft` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft) clone and to the folder storing library repositories.
If you are not sure if they are set correctly, set them like this:

```
UK_ROOT ?= $(PWD)/../../unikraft
UK_LIBS ?= $(PWD)/../../libs
```

#### Linuxu, x86_64

First, we will build the image for the **linuxu** platform.
As the resulting image will be an ELF, we can only run the **x86** Unikraft image.
We follow the steps:

1. While in the `helloworld` folder, run

   ```console
   $ make menuconfig
   ```

1. From `Architecture Selection`, select `Architecture` -> `x86 compatible`.
1. From `Platform Configuration`, select `Linux user space`.
1. Save, exit and run

   ```console
   $ make
   ```

1. The resulting image, `app-helloworld_linuxu-x86_64`, will be present in the `build/` folder.
   Run it.

   ```console
   $ ./build/app-helloworld_linuxu-x86_64
   ```

#### KVM, x86_64

Next, we will build the image for the **kvm** platform.
Before starting the process, make sure that you have the necessary tools, listed in the [Required Tools](/community/hackathons/sessions/behind-scenes/#required-tools) section.
We follow the steps:

1. Run

   ```console
   $ make menuconfig
   ```

1. We will leave the architecture as is, for now.
1. From `Platform Configuration`, select `KVM guest`.
1. Save, exit and run

   ```console
   $ make
   ```

1. Load the resulting image in QEMU by using

   ```console
   $ sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ./build/app-helloworld_kvm-x86_64 -nographic
   ```

Besides `-nographic`, no other option is needed to run the `app-helloworld` application.
Other, more complex applications, will require more options given to the `qemu-system-x86_64` command.

We have run Unikraft in the emulation mode, with the command from above.
We can also run it in the virtualization mode, by adding the `-enable-kvm` option.
You may receive a warning, `host doesn't support requested feature:`.
This is because KVM uses a generic CPU model.
You can instruct KVM to use your local CPU model, by adding `-cpu host` to the command.

The final command will look like this:

```console
$ sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cpu host -kernel ./build/app-helloworld_kvm-x86_64 -nographic
```

While we are here, we can check some differences between emulation and virtualization.
Record the time needed by each image to run, using `time`, like this:

```console
$ time sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ./build/app-helloworld_kvm-x86_64 -nographic
$ time sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cpu host -kernel ./build/app-helloworld_kvm-x86_64 -nographic
```

Because `helloworld` is a simple application, the **real** running time will be similar.
The differences are where each image runs most of its time: in user space, or in kernel space.
Find an explanation to those differences.

#### KVM, ARM

To configure Unikraft for the ARM architecture, go to the configuration menu, like before, and select, from `Architecture Selection`, `Armv8 compatible`.
Save and exit the configuration.
As a new architecture is selected, you have to clean the previously compiled files:

```console
$ make clean
```

After cleaning, build the image:

```console
$ make
```

To run Unikraft, use the following command:

```console
$ sudo qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt -cpu cortex-a57 -kernel ./build/app-helloworld_kvm-arm64 -nographic
```

Note that now we need to provide a machine and a CPU model to be emulated, as there are no defaults available.
If you want to find information about other machines, run

```console
$ sudo qemu-system-aarch64 -machine help
```
