Unikraft is a configurable operating system, where each component can be modified, configured, according to the userâ€™s needs.
This configuration is done using a version of Kconfig, through the **Config.uk** files.
In these files, options are added to enable libraries, applications and different components of the Unikraft core.
The user can then apply those configuration options, using `make menuconfig`, which generates an internal configuration file that can be understood by the build system, **.config**.
Once configured, the Unikraft image can be built, using `make`, and run, using the appropriate method (Linux ELF loader, qemu-kvm, xen, others).

Configuration can be done in 3 ways:

* Manually, using

  ```
  $ make menuconfig
  ```

* Adding a dependency in **Config.uk** for a component, so that the dependency gets automatically selected when the component is enabled.
  This is done using `depends on` and `select` keywords in **Config.uk**.
  The configuration gets loaded and the **.config** file is generated by running

  ```
  $ make menuconfig
  ```

  This type of configuration removes some configuration steps, but not all of them.

* Writing the desired configuration in **kraft.yaml**.
  The configuration gets loaded and the **.config** file is generated by running

  ```
  $ kraft configure
  ```

In this session, we will use the first and the last configuration options.
