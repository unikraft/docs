Having the output of `ukdebug`, go through the Unikraft code, in the `unikraft` folder.
Find the components that you have seen in the outputs, in the platform library, and where the kernel messages are sent.
The platform library, even though is called a library, is not in the `lib` subfolder.
It is placed in the `plat` folder.
Explore the code, at your own pace.
Can you also find where the main function is called?
