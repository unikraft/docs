* Unikraft is a special type of operating system, that can be configured to match the needs of a specific application.
* This configuration is made possible by a system based on Kconfig, that uses **Config.uk** files to add possible configurations, and **.config** files to store the specific configuration for a build.
* The configuration step creates symbols that are visible in both Makefiles and source code.
* Each component has its own **Makefile.uk**, where source files can be added, removed, or be made dependent on the configuration.
* Unikraft has an internal libc, but it can use others, more complex and complete, like newlib and musl.
* Being an operating system, it needs to be run by a hypervisor, like KVM, xen, to work at full capacity.
  It can also be run as an ELF, in Linux, but in this way the true power of Unikraft is not achieved.
