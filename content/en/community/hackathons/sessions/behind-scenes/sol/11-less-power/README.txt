If you delete Config.uk, none of the configurations that you made so far,
like the one with reading the file, or the new source file added, will work anymore.
Also, if you look into the menuconfig, you will see that the Application
Configuration menu is empty. Without the Config.uk file, there's no way to
make Unikraft fit your (and other user's) needs.

An easy exercise to finish the day :)
