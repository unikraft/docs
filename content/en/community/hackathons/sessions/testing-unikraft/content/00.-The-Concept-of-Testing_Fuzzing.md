**Fuzzing** or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program.
The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks.

The most popular OS fuzzers are [kAFL](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kAFL) and [syzkaller](https://github.com/google/syzkaller), but research in this area is very active.
