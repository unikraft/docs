Unikraft boot process is centred around the idea of constructors.
Not to be confused with class constructors, Unikraft's constructors are simply functions registered in a special section inside the image and ran at boot time.
We use the `section` [attribute](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.2/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html) from GCC to tell the compiler to a specific section inside the binary, in our case `.uk_ctortab`.
Later at boot, we go through each value stored in the section and run it:

```C++
uk_ctortab_foreach(ctorfn, __init_array_start, __init_array_end) {
  if (!*ctorfn)
    continue;

  uk_pr_debug("Call constructor: %p()...\n", *ctorfn);
  (*ctorfn)();
}
```

There are multiple such loops through the boot code found in `ukboot/boot.c`.
The testing framework simply registers the test function that needs to be called during the run.
