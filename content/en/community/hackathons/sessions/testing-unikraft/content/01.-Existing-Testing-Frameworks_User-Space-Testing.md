Right now, there are a plethora of existing testing frameworks for different programming languages.
For example, Google Test is a testing framework for C++ whereas JUnit for Java.
Let's take a quick look at how Google Test works:

We have the following C++ code for the factorial in a function.cpp:

```C++
int Factorial(int n) {
  int result = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i;
  }

  return result;
}
```

To create a test file, we'll create a new C++ source that includes `gtest/gtest.h`
We can now define the tests using the `TEST` macro. We named this test `Negative` and added it to the `FactorialTest`.

```C++
TEST(FactorialTest, Negative) {
...
}
```

Inside the test we can write C++ code as inside a function and use existing macros for adding test checks via macros such as `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_GT`.

```C++
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

TEST(FactorialTest, Negative)
{
      EXPECT_EQ(1, Factorial(-5));
      EXPECT_EQ(1, Factorial(-1));
      EXPECT_GT(Factorial(-10), 0);
}
```

In order to run the test we add a main function similar to the one below to the test file that we have just created:

```C++
int main(int argc, char ∗∗argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Easy?
This is not always the case, for example this [sample](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/samples/sample9_unittest.cc) shows a more advanced and nested test.
