Add a new test suite for [`nolibc`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/nolibc) with four test cases in it.
You can use any POSIX function from nolibc for this task.
Feel free to look over the [documentation](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/uktest/include/uk/test.h) to write more complex tests.
