The main framework used by Linux for testing is KUnit.
The building block of KUnit are test cases, functions with the signature `void (*)(struct kunit *test)`. For example:

```C++
void example_add_test(struct kunit *test)
{
  /* check if calling add(1,0) is equal to 1 */
  KUNIT_EXPECT_EQ(test, 1, add(1, 0));
}
```

We can use macros such as `KUNIT_EXPECT_EQ` to verify results.

A set of test cases is called a **test suite**.
In the example below, we can see how one can add a test suite.

```C
static struct kunit_case example_add_cases[] = {
        KUNIT_CASE(example_add_test1),
        KUNIT_CASE(example_add_test2),
        KUNIT_CASE(example_add_test3),
        {}
};

static struct kunit_suite example_test_suite = {
        .name = "example",
        .init = example_test_init,
        .exit = example_test_exit,
        .test_cases = example_add_cases,
};
kunit_test_suite(example_test_suite);
```

The API is pretty intuitive and thoroughly detailed in the [official documentation](https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/dev-tools/kunit/usage.html).

KUnit is not the only tool used for testing Linux, there are tens of tools used to test Linux at any time:

* Test suites: Linux Test Project (collection of tools), static code analyzers (Coverity, coccinelle, smatch, sparse), module tests (KUnit), fuzzing tools (Trinity, Syzkaller) and subsystem tests.
* Automatic testing: kisskb, 0Day, kernelci, Kerneltests.

In the figure below, we can see that as more and better tools were developed we saw an increase in reported vulnerabilities.
There was a peak in 2017, after which a steady decrease which may be caused by the amount of tools used to verify patches before being upstreamed.
