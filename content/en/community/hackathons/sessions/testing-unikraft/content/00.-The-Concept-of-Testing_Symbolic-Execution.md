As per Wikipedia, **symbolic** execution is a means of analyzing a program to determine what inputs cause each part of a program to execute.
An interpreter follows the program, assuming symbolic values for inputs rather than obtaining actual inputs as normal execution of the program would.
An example of a program being symbolically executed can be seen in the figure below:

```C
int x, y;

if ( x > y ) {

    x = x + y;

    y = y * 3;

    if ( y > x ) {
        return 0;
    }

    crash();
}
```

The most popular symbolic execution engines are KLEE, S2E and angr.
