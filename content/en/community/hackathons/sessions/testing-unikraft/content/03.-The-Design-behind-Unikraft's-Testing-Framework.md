The key ideas that were followed when writing `uktest` are:

* Non-sophisticated. It should follow an existing framework (e.g. KUnit) in order to reuse the existing documentation and have a smaller learning curve
* Ability to specify when to run the tests during the boot process
* Written in C
* Should not conflict with other unit test frameworks (e.g. the one used for testing libraries and apps such as Google Test)
* BSD-compatible license
* Have the ability to write tests as a whole file or as in-line tests above a method
