OSv uses a different approach.
They're using the Boost test framework alongside tests consisting of standalone simple applications.
For example, to test `read` they have the following [standalone app](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/blob/master/tests/tst-read.cc), whereas for [testing the vfs](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/blob/master/tests/tst-vfs.cc), they use boost.
