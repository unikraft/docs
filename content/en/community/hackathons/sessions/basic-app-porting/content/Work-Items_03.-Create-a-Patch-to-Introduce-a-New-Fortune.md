There is a well-known kernel quote, which should be introduced to this library as an Easter egg for unikernel users:

"[Kernel hacking: where the time to solve a problem is inversely proportional to the size of the resulting diff](https://twitter.com/avsm/status/1265666433914191876)"

  -- Anil Madhavapeddy

Please add this quote to `libfortune` as a patch so it is only available when used with unikernels.
