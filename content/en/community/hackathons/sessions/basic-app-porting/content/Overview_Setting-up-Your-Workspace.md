Applications which are brought to Unikraft are actually libraries.
Everything in Unikraft is "libracized", so it is no surprise to find out that even applications are a form of library: they are a single component which interact with other components; have their own options and build files; and, interact in the same ways in which other libraries interact with each other.
The "main" difference between actual libraries and applications, is that we later invoke the application's `main` method.
The different ways to do this are [covered later in this tutorial](#invoking-the-applications-main-method).
