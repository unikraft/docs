The focus of this session will be on porting new libraries to Unikraft and preparing them for upstreaming to the [main organization's GitHub](https://github.com/unikraft).

Being a library operating system, the unikernels created using Unikraft are mainly a collection of internal and external libraries, alongside the ported application.
As a consequence, a large library pool is mandatory in order to make this project compatible with as many applications as possible.
