Let's suppose that we need kd tree support and that we found a C library, [`kdtree`](http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/sw/kdtree/), that does what we need.
After downloading and inspecting this library, we can see that it also has a set of examples, which can be used by us to test if we ported this library properly.
Work in the `work/02-task-porting/app-kdtree/.unikraft/libs/kdtree/` and follow the `TODO` lines.
For all the work items you can (and should) use the files from the [tutorial](/community/hackathons/sessions/contributing-to-unikraft/#example-of-external-library) as reference.
