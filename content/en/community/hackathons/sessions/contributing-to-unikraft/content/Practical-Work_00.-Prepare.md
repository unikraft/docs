Let's suppose that we need kd tree support and that we found a C library, [`kdtree`](http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/sw/kdtree/), that does what we need.
After downloading and inspecting this library, we can see that it also has a set of examples, which can be used by us to test if we ported this library properly.
Move the skeleton of this library, `work/02-task-porting/src/libs/kdtree/`, in the `$UK_LIBS` directory and complete the porting process by following the `TODO` lines.
