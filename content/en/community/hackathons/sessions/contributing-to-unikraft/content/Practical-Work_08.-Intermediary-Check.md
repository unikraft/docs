Until now we have registered the library and its sources, and we should be able to compile an unikernel with it, *if it doesn't have any more unresolved dependencies*.
After you complete the application `Makefile`, run `make` and try to see if everything compiles.

If needed, provide additional flags in order to suppress the compile warnings generated by this library.

**Note**: You might find that other external libraries are needed for `kdtree` to compile.
If it seems like a more extended `libc` is needed, add `musl` to the build.

**Note**: You can leave the application's `main()` function empty for now, the resulted unikernel will just print the `Unikraft` banner.

**Hint**: Check the [tutorial](/community/hackathons/sessions/contributing-to-unikraft/#example-of-external-library) for adding dependencies.

In the end, if all is good, you will see the `kdtree` source files in the `make` output:

```text
CC      libvfscore: pipe.o
CC      libvfscore: eventpoll.o
CC      libkdtree: kdtree.o
```
