Define a variable with the path of the default directory obtained by extracting the original library's archive.
You can go to the application directory, add the `kdtree` library in the `Makefile`, configure the application and run `make prepare`.
After that, the extracted content of the `kdtree` archive should be placed under `build/libkdtree/origin/...`.
