Let's start with installing kraft (and validating the installation).

First of all, make sure you have all the dependencies installed:

```console
$ sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential \
        libncurses-dev libyaml-dev flex git wget socat bison \
        unzip uuid-runtime python3-pip
```

You'll also need QEMU for launching virtual/emulated machines which will run unikernels targeting the KVM platform:

```console
$ sudo apt-get -y install qemu-kvm qemu-system-x86
```

To install the latest version of kraft, simply run:

```console
$ pip3 install git+https://github.com/unikraft/kraft.git@staging
```

After installing or updating kraft, the first step is to download / update the software components available for building unikernel images.
For this, run:

```console
$ kraft list update
```

It's very likely that running the command above will result in the following error:

```console
GitHub rate limit exceeded.  You can tell kraft to use a personal access token by setting the UK_KRAFT_GITHUB_TOKEN environmental variable.
```

If this is the case, first create a GitHub personal access token with `repo:public-repo` permissions by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
Then, use the following command:

```console
$ UK_KRAFT_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_GitHub_token_here> kraft list update
```

After this is done, you can get a list of all components that are available for use with kraft:

```console
$ kraft list

So, with kraft we have an interface to configure, build and run unikernel images based on Unikraft core, (external) platforms, (external) libraries and applications.

By default, these are saved to `~/.unikraft/` directory, which is also the value of the `UK_WORKDIR` environment variable used by kraft.
This represents the working directory for all Unikraft components.
This is the usual layout of the `~/.unikraft/` directory:
```
|-- apps - This is where you would normally place existing app build
|-- archs - Here we place our custom arch's files
|-- libs - This is where the build system looks for external library pool sources
|-- plats - The files for our custom plats are placed here
`-- unikraft - The core source code of the Unikraft Unikernel
```

Apart from the general `UK_WORKDIR` environment variable that points to the overall directory, there are also environment variables available for the above subdirectories:
```
UK_ROOT - The directory for Unikraft's core source code [default: $UK_WORKDIR/unikraft]
UK_LIBS - The directory of all the external Unikraft libraries [default: $UK_WORKDIR/libs]
UK_APPS - The directory of all the template applications [default: $UK_WORKDIR/apps]
```

After successfully running the above commands, kraft is now installed on our system and we can get to building and running unikernels.
