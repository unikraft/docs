For the final work item, you will have to update the source code from the second task, so that it stores in a file the received string before sending the encoded one back to the client.
In order to achieve this, you must have the previous work item completed.

The available resources are the exact same, you will simply have to modify `main.c`. Make sure to select `newlib` and `lwip` in `menuconfig` before building the application.

To test if your application ran successfully, check to see whether the original strings you sent through the client are present in that file or not.
