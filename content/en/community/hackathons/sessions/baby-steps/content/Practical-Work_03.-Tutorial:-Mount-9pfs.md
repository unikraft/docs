In this tutorial, we will see what we would need to do if we wanted to have a filesystem available.
To make it easy, we will use the `9pfs` filesystem, as well as the `newlib` library.
The latter is used so that we have available an API that would enable us to interact with this filesystem (functions such as `lseek`, `open`).


We will need to download `newlib`. You can clone it directly:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/unikraft/lib-newlib.git ~/.unikraft/libs/newlib
```

Or fetch it using `kraft`:

```console
$ kraft list pull newlib
```

Next, we include it in our `Makefile`:

```Makefile
LIBS := $(UK_LIBS)/lwip:$(UK_LIBS)/newlib
```

And now, for the final step, through `make menuconfig` make sure you have selected `libnewlib` as well as `9pfs: 9p filesystem` inside the `Library Configuration` menu.
We will also check these options inside `Library Configuration` -> `vfscore: Configuration`:

![fs2 selection menu](/community/hackathons/sessions/baby-steps/images/menuconfig_select_fs2.png)

![fs3 selection menu](/community/hackathons/sessions/baby-steps/images/menuconfig_select_fs3.png)

What is more, you should also have present in the current directory an additional directory called `fs0`:

```console
$ mkdir fs0
```

And so, `fs0` will contain whatever files you create, read from or write to from within your unikernel.

For now, just make sure it successfully builds. If it does, move on to the next work item.
