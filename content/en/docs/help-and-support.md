## Help & Support

If you are running into problems, please join [the Unikraft Discord server](https://bit.ly/UnikraftDiscord) to ask questions and take part in discussions.
Discord is the main community channel, where the community interacts and is welcoming providing support to users and would-be contributors.
It's organized into different channels specific to community projects and teams.
It also features voice channels used for live interaction inside the community.

You can also use the [GitHub Discussions forum](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/discussions).
Discord is mostly used for lengthier discussions and interactions inside the community.
GitHub discussions is mostly used for specific situations that you want clarifications on.

For any errors, issues or problems you may run into, you can also [open an issue](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/issues).
