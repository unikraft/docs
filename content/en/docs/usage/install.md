## Installing `kraft`

To get started, please install the `kraft` command-line client which is used for
defining, configuring, building, and running Unikraft applications. Installation
can be performed in a number of different ways depending on your preferences or
system requirements.

### Debian/Ubuntu

#### Prerequisites

 * Debian Buster (10)
 * Debian Stretch (9)
 * Ubuntu Focal (20.04) LTS
 * Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) LTS
 * Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) LTS

#### Installation Instructions

The process for installing `kraft` on Debian or Ubuntu is straight forward and
we recommend using our hosted APT managed repository to access the latest
updates.

1. Update the APT package index and install packages to allow APT to use a
   repository over HTTPS:

   ```console
   $ sudo apt install \
       apt-transport-https \
       ca-certificates \
       software-properties-common \
       curl \
       gnupg2
   ```

2. Add the Linux-distribution GPG key:

   ```console
   $ curl -fsSL https://releases.unikraft.org/linux/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

3. Verify that you now have the key with the following fingerprint:

   ```console
   $ apt-key fingerprint 8D14C246

   pub   rsa4096 2020-10-22 [SC] [expires: 2024-10-22]
       DCE2 072B 5FAE 29BF F78C  9AED 5989 A47D 8D14 C246
   uid           [ unknown] Unikraft <unikraft@unikraft.org>
   uid           [ unknown] Unikraft Monkey <monkey@unikraft.io>
   sub   rsa4096 2020-10-22 [E] [expires: 2024-10-22]
   ```


4. Add the remote repository by using the following command for **Debian**:

   ```console
   $ sudo add-apt-repository \
       "deb [arch=amd64] http://releases.unikraft.org/linux/debian \
       $(lsb_release -cs) \
       stable"
   ```

   Or, for **Ubuntu**:

   ```console
   $ sudo add-apt-repository \
       "deb [arch=amd64] http://releases.unikraft.org/linux/ubuntu \
       $(lsb_release -cs) \
       stable"
   ```

   **Note:** To add the `staging` branch of the kraft repository, remove or
   append to the "`stable`" branch-name keyword.
   {{< /alert >}}

5. Update the APT package index on your machine and install `unikraft-tools`:

   ```console
   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get install unikraft-tools
   ```

   This will install `kraft` along with additional packages required to build
   a Unikraft unikernel, including `gcc`, `make`, etc.

### Docker

You can use the container environment for `kraft` if you do not wish to install
all the dependencies which are required for building Unikraft unikernels.
Typically, this includes `gcc`, `make` and friends in order to compile a
unikernel application as well as hypervisor toolchain, such as `qemu-system-x86`
in order to instantiate the unikernel itself.

To quickly get started with a known working environment, you can use the kraft
Docker environment, which can be a good starting ground and workspace.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure that Docker has been installed on your machine.

#### Installation Instructions

To simply get started, attach a workspace as a volume to the kraft container
image like so:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/usr/src/unikraft \
    --entrypoint bash
    unikraft/kraft:staging
```

This will attach you to a new workspace environment where you can begin using
`kraft`.  There are two versions of the `kraft` Docker environment, with the
following tags:

 * `unikraft/kraft:staging` contains the latest staging version of `kraft`
   and is continiously updated with new commits to this branch; and,
 * `unikraft/kraft:latest` which contains the latest stable version of
   `kraft`.

It is possible to launch Unikraft unikernels via this container environment by
mounting the correct paths to your VMM sockets.  For example, with KVM and QEMU
you can launch the container environment like so:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/usr/src/unikraft \
    --device /dev/kvm
    --entrypoint bash
    unikraft/kraft:staging
```

**Containers and unikernels are not the same!**  Learn more about the differences
between these runtime systems in [virtualization](/docs/concepts/virtualization).

### With `pip`

To install `kraft` manually using the python toolchain, you can do this easily
too by specifying the install location of the repository from
[GitHub](https://github.com/unikraft/kraft.git):

```console
pip3 install git+https://github.com/unikraft/kraft.git
```

### Install to hack

If you have found a bug, issue or wish to extend the kraft codebase, then simply
clone the repository and install kraft in "edit mode":

```console
git clone https://github.com/unikraft/kraft.git
pip3 install -e ./kraft
```

More information about `kraft`'s internal build system can be found by
running `make help` within the repository:

```txt
Usage: [FLAGS=...] make TARGET

  kraft's build system is designed to help package, test and release the
  unikraft-tools software suite.  To find out more information about a specfic
