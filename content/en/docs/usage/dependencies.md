## Managing Unikraft Ecosystem

Once `kraft` is installed, you can use it to manage dependencies for
applications, including finding and retrieving existing applications, libraries,
platforms and architectures.

Libraries are additional software components that will be linked with Unikraft for the final image.
Each unikernel image is using its specific libraries.
They are typically common libraries (such as OpenSSL or LWIP) that have been ported on top of Unikraft.
The libraries, also called **external** libraries are located in specialized repositories in the [Unikraft organization](https://github.com/unikraft), those whose names start with `lib-`.

The application is the actual application code.
It typically provides the `main()` function (or equivalent) and is reliant on Unikraft and external libraries.
The avalaible applications that have been ported on top of Unikraft are located in repositories in the [Unikraft organization](https://github.com/unikraft/), those whose names start with `app-`.

An important role of the core Unikraft component is providing support for different platforms and architectures.
A platform is the virtualization / runtime environment used to run the resulting unikernel image.

## Unikraft directories structure

By default, all components pulled by `kraft` are saved to `~/.unikraft/` directory, which is also the default value for the `UK_WORKDIR` environment variable used by `kraft`.
This is the usual layout of the `~/.unikraft` directory:

```text
|-- apps - This is where you would normally place existing app builds
|-- archs - Here we place our custom arch's files
|-- libs - This is where the build system looks for external library pool sources
|-- plats - The files for our custom plats are placed here
`-- unikraft - The core source code of the Unikraft Unikernel
```

If you want to keep your unikraft components in a different location, you can do that and export the environment variable `UK_WORKDIR`.
Apart from that, there are also environment variables available for the above subdirectories:

| Environment Variable |                       Purpouse                       |         Default        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `UK_ROOT`            | The directory for Unikraft's core source code        | `$UK_WORKDIR/unikraft` |
| `UK_LIBS`            | The directory of all the external Unikraft libraries | `$UK_WORKDIR/libs`     |
| `UK_APPS`            | The directory of all the template applications       | `$UK_WORKDIR/apps`     |


## `kraft list`

You can find a list of all aplication, libraries and platforms by using:

```console
$ kraft list
```

You can see the component name, current version, release date and the time of the last check.
All the components already avalaible on your system, in your `UK_WORKDIR` directory will be shown green.
All the other components will be colored red.

```text
APPLICATIONS    	VERSION 	RELEASED  	LAST CHECKED
helloworld      	0.6     	22 Jan 22 	17 hours ago
httpreply       	0.6     	02 Dec 21 	17 hours ago
python3         	0.6     	2 days ago	17 hours ago
duktape         	0.6     	02 Dec 21 	17 hours ago
helloworld-cpp  	0.6     	02 Dec 21 	17 hours ago
```

You can add origins for kraft to use in the `.kraftrc` file, under `[list]`.
If you create a new library using the `kraft lib` command shown below, you can add the new local library to the `.kraftrc` file by using:

```console
$ kraft lib add ~/path/to/local/lib
$ kraft list update
```

You can check that everything worked fine and view basic informations about the new library by using:

```console
$ kraft list show LIBNAME
```

You can manually add URLs, git, git+ssh and wildcards in the `.kraftrc` file:

```text
[list]
origins = [
	"https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git",
	"https://github.com/unikraft/plat-*",
	"https://github.com/unikraft/app-*",
	"https://github.com/unikraft/lib-*",
]
```

After every update to `.kraftrc`, run:

```console
$ kraft list update
```
