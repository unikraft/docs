## Suggestions

When reviewing pull requests you can directly [suggest changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) to the original author.
Suggestions are direct updates to the code (or comments or documentation).
They are made in the review screen of a pull request.

Suggestions will then be [incorporated](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request#applying-suggested-changes) by the author.
The reviewer will be added as co-author to the commit resulting from suggested changes.

Of course, the author can simply edit the submission on their own system and add the suggested changes by hand.
