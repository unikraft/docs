## Coding Style

### Syntax Recommendations

The Unikraft project uses the Linux kernel coding style which is mostly true for the Unikraft base libraries, new source files, and KConfig files.
Please note that ported libraries from existing sources may use different style definitions (e.g., `lib/fdt`).
Please follow the appropriate style depending on where you want to modify or introduce new code.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="You can find the documentation of the Linux kernel style <a href='https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html'>here</a>." />}}

You can also use `.clang-format` to check your patches.
Most code closely follows an automatically-formatted style defined by the [.clang-format](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/.clang-format) file in the repository's root directory.
However, since this is an automated formatting tool, it's not perfect, and the Unikraft code can deviate from the `clang-format`'s programmatically created output (especially in the aesthetics of assignment alignments).
Use `clang-format` as a helpful tool, but with a grain of salt.
Again, note that some parts of the code (e.g. lib/fdt) follow different coding styles that you should follow if you change this code.
In the future, me might provide .clang-format files appropriate for those libraries.
We would also be very happy to accept `.clang-format` definitions for those.


### Code Documentation

Unikraft does not have a strict rule for formatting code comments.
It tries to follow mostly the code comments style of the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#commenting) or the [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) style.
Try to keep comments uniform across the file you are editing.

### Commit Message Format

In order to simplify reading and searching the patch history, please use the following format for the short commit message:

```txt
[selector]/[component name]: [Your short message]
```

Where `[selector]` can be one of the following:

| Selector    | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `arch`      | Patch for the architecture code in `arch/`.  `[component]` is the architecture (e.g, `x86`) applies also for corresponding headers in `include/uk/arch/`.             |
| `plat`      | Patch for one of the platform libraries in `plat/`, `[component]` is the platform (e.g, `linuxu`).  This applies also for corresponding headers in `include/uk/plat/` |
| `include`   | Changes to general Unikraft headers, e.g. `include/`, `include/uk`.                                                                                                   |
| `lib`       | Patch for one of the Unikraft base libraries (not external) in `lib/`, `[component]` is the library name without lib prefix (e.g, `fdt`).                             |
| `build`     | Changes to build system or generic configurations, `[component]` is optional.                                                                                         |

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="Commit messages, along with all source files follow a 80-character rule." />}}

If no `[selector]` applies, define your own and cross your fingers that the `reviewer(s)` do(es) not complain. :-)

Sometimes a single change required multiple commit identifiers.
In general this should be avoided by splitting a commits into multiple ones.
But for the rare case use a comma separated list of identifiers and/or use an asterisk for `[component]` (according to the sense).
For example:

```txt
lib/nolibc, plat/xen: Add support for foobar
arch/*: Add spinlocks
```

The short message part should start with a capital and be formulated in simple present.

The long message part is pretty free form but should be used to explain the reasons for the commit, what has been changed and why.
It is important to provide enough information to allow `reviewers` and other developers to understand the commit's purpose.

### Developer's Certificate of Origin

Please note that all commits **must be signed off**.
This is required so that you certify that you submitted the patch under the [Developer's Certificate of Origin](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#developer-s-certificate-of-origin-1-1).

```txt
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Signing off is done by adding the following line after the long commit message:

```txt
Signed-off-by: $FULL_NAME <$EMAIL>
```

You can also use the `--signoff` or `-s` parameter of `git commit` when writing commit messages.

### Example Commit Message

```txt
lib/ukdebug: Add new trondle calls

Add some new trondle calls to the foobar interface to support the new
zot feature.
