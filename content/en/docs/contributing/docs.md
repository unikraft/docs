## Documentation

As with the other parts of Unikraft, we welcome contributios to the [documentation repository](https://github.com/unikraft/docs).
Documentation is written using [GitHub Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/).

Please use pull requests (PRs) to submit corrections and improvements to documentation.
You can add entire sections if you think a topic is missing or update existing ones with missing information.

You can also open up an issue to signal a problem or a missing part in the documentation that you request someone to fix.

We use English as a documentation language.
Please proof read your text before submitting a pull request.

Write each sentence on a new line.
This way, changing one sentence only affects one line in the source code.

Prefer using the 1st person plural.
Use phrases like "we run the command / app", "we look at the source code", "we provide support".
