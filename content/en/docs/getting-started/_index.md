## Getting started with Unikraft

The easiest way to get started with Unikraft is to use the command-line utility
`kraft`, which is a companion tool used for defining, configuring, building, and
running Unikraft applications.  With `kraft` you can seamlessly create a build
environment for your unikernel and painlessly manage dependencies for its build.

## Installing the CLI companion tool `kraft`

The kraft tool and Unikraft build system have a number of package requirements;
please run the following command (on apt-get-based systems) to install the
requirements:

```shell-script
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  build-essential \
  libncurses-dev \
  libyaml-dev \
  flex \
  git \
  wget \
  socat \
  bison \
  unzip \
  uuid-runtime \
  python3 \
  python3-setuptools
```

To install kraft simply run:

```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/unikraft/kraft.git
```

You can then type kraft to see its help menu:

Building an Application

The simplest way to get the sources for, build and run an application is by running the following commands:

```bash
kraft list
kraft up -p PLATFORM -m ARCHITECTURE APP
```

You can also build and run an applications from the existing templates by using the `-t` option.
For example, building and running the [helloworld app](https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld):

```bash
kraft up -p kvm -m x86_64 -t helloworld helloworld
```

For more information about all the steps behind `kraft up`, check [Creating an App](docs/usage/init).
For more information about the `up` command type kraft up -h.
For more information about kraft type kraft -h or read the documentation at Unikraftâ€™s website.
If you find any problems please fill out an issue. Thank you!
