## Writing tests

As of [Unikraft v0.6 (Dione)](https://unikraft.org/release/v0.6.0>), tests are a mandatory addition to new Unikraft contribuitions when contributions are of the following categories:

 * New Unikraft core libraries (located within the core's `lib/` directory);
 * New functions, methods or features; and,
 * Overall new code additions;


This series introduces a minimal implementation testing infrastructure into Unikraft. 
The primary contents includes the definition of a test (or suite of tests) and the mechanism by which one can use to register the suite to be run.

## Overview

In `uktest`, tests are organised hierarchically powered by the the lowest common denominator: the assertion.
This organisation is inspired by [KUnit](https://kunit.dev), the Linux Kernel's in-house testing system.
[For licensing reasons](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) the Unikraft project cannot use this source code.
However, by inspiration, we can organise the `uktest` library following a similar pattern:

 1. The assertion: repersents the lowest common denominator of a test: some boolean operation which, when true, a single test passes.
 Assertions are often used in-line and their usage should be no different to the traditional use of the `ASSERT` macro.
 In `uktest`, we introduce a new definition: `UK_TEST_EXPECT` which has one parameters: the same boolean opeation which is true-to-form of the traditional `ASSERT` macro.
 With `uktest`, however, the macro is intelligently placed in context within a case (see 2.).
 Additional text or descriptive explanation of the text can also be provided with the auxiliary and similar macro `UK_TEST_ASSERTF`.

 2. The test case: often, assertions are not alone in their means to check the legitimacy of operation in some function.
 We find that a "case" is best way to organise a group of assertions in which one particular function of some system is under-going testing.
 A case is independent of other cases, but related in the same sub-system.
 For this reason we register them together in the same test suite.

 3. The test suite: represents a group of test cases.
 This is the final and upper-most heirarchical repesentation of tests and their groupings.
 With assertions grouped into test cases and test cases grouped into a test suite, we end this organisation in a fashion which allows us to follow a common design pattern within Unikraft: the registration model.
 The syntax follows similar to other registation models within Unikraft, e.g. `ukbus`.
 However, `uktest`'s registation model is more powerful (see Test Execution).


## Creating tests

To register a test suite with `uktest`, we simply invoke `uk_test_suite_register` with a unique symbol name.
This symbol is used along with test cases in order to create the references to one-another.
Each test case has only two input parameters: a reference to the suite is part, as well as a canonical name for the case itself.
Generally, the following pattern is used for test suites:

`$LIBNAME_$TESTSUITENAME_testsuite`

An the following for test cases:

`$LIBNAME_test_$TESTCASENAME`

To create a case, simply invoke the `UK_TESTCASE` macro with the two parameters described previously, and use in the context of a function, for example:

```c
UK_TESTCASE(uktest_mycase_testsuite, uktest_test_case)
{
        int x = 1;
        UK_TEST_EXPECT(x > 0);
}
```

Finally, to register the case with a suite (see next section), call one of the possible registration functions:

```c
uk_testsuite_register(uktest_mycase_testsuite, NULL);
```

The above snippet can be organised within a library in a number of ways such as in-line or as an individual file representing the suite.
There are a number of test suite registration handles which are elaborated on in next section.
It should be noted that multiple test suites can exist within a library in order to test multiple features or components of said library.

### Recommended Conventions

In order to achieve consistency in the use of `uktest` across the Unikraft code base, the following recommendation is made regarding the registration of test suites:

 1. A single test suite should be organised into its own file, prefixed with `test_`, e.g. `test_feature.c`.
 This makes it easy to spot if tests for a library are being compiled in.
 2. If there is more than one test suite for a library, all tests suites of the library should be stored within a new folder located at the root of the library named `tests/`.
 3. All tests suites should have a corresponding KConfig option, prefixed with the library name and then the word "TEST", e.g. `LIBNAME_TEST_`.
 4. Every library implementing one or more suite of tests must have a new menuconfig housing all test suite options under the name `LIBNAME_TEST`.
 This menuconfig option must invoke all the suites if `LIBUKTEST_ALL` is set to true.

## Registering tests

`uktest`'s registation model allows for the execution of tests at different levels of the boot process.
All tests occur before the invocation of the application's `main` method.
This is done such that the validity of the kernel-space functions can be legitimised before actual application code is invoked.
A fail-fast option is provided in order to crash the kernel in case of failures for earlier error diagnosis.

When registering a test suite, one can hook into either the constructor "`ctor`" table or initialisation table "`inittab`".
This allows for running tests before or after certain libraries or sub-systems are invoked during the boot process.

The following registation methods are available:

 * `UK_TESTSUITE_AT_CTORCALL_PRIO`,
 * `uk_testsuite_early_prio`,
 * `uk_testsuite_plat_prio`,
 * `uk_testsuite_lib_prio`,
 * `uk_testsuite_rootfs_prio`,
 * `uk_testsuite_sys_prio`,
 * `uk_testsuite_late_prio`,
 * `uk_testsuite_prio` and,
 * `uk_testsuite_register`.

## Example test

Example testcase taken from the [USoC](https://usoc21.unikraft.org/docs/sessions/06-testing-unikraft/) event for the `vfscore` internal library:

```c
UK_TESTCASE(vfscore_stat_testsuite, vfscore_test_newfile)
{
    /* First check if mount works all right */
    int ret = mount("", "/", "ramfs", 0, NULL);
    UK_TEST_EXPECT_SNUM_EQ(ret, 0);

    ret = mkdir("/foo", S_IRWXU);
    UK_TEST_EXPECT_SNUM_EQ(ret, 0);

    fd = open("/foo/file.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, S_IRWXU);
    UK_TEST_EXPECT_SNUM_GT(fd, 2);

    UK_TEST_EXPECT_SNUM_EQ(
        write(fd, "hello\n", sizeof("hello\n")),
        sizeof("hello\n")
    );
    fsync(fd);
}

/* Register the test suite */
uk_testsuite_register(vfscore_stat_testsuite, NULL);
```

## Enabling tests

To enable tests we need to add the test suite to it's respective `Config.uk` file:

```
menuconfig LIBVFSCORE_TEST
    bool "Test vfscore"
    select LIBVFSCORE_TEST_STAT if LIBUKTEST_ALL
    default n

if LIBVFSCORE_TEST

config LIBVFSCORE_TEST_STAT
    bool "test: stat()"
    select LIBRAMFS
    default n

endif
```
