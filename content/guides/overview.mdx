  We present the initial steps in setting up the Unikraft development / usage environment.
  Students will use the basic Unikraft toolchain to set up, configure, build and run Unikraft images.
  Expected time: 60 minutes

## Set Up

You will be part of a team of 3-4 people.
Discuss on the [thread](https://discord.com/channels/762976922531528725/1385697301007433898) and create/announce your team on Discord.
Each team will be assigned a Discord channel to work together.
You can use the `#hack-team-XX-voice` channels on the [Discord server](https://bit.ly/UnikraftDiscord).
You will need a Linux environment for this session.
You can use a virtual machine, but we strongly recommend a native Linux install.

You will need to install the following packages:

* `build-essential` / `base-devel` / `@development-tools` (the meta-package that includes `make`, `gcc` and other development-related packages)
* `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`
* `sudo`
* `flex`
* `bison`
* `git`
* `wget`
* `uuid-runtime`
* `qemu-system-x86`
* `qemu-system-arm`
* `qemu-kvm`
* `sgabios`

On Ubuntu, Debian, and other `apt`-based distributions, you can use the following command to install the requirements:

```console
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends \
        build-essential \
        sudo \
        gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu \
        libncurses-dev \
        libyaml-dev \
        flex \
        bison \
        git \
        wget \
        uuid-runtime \
        qemu-kvm \
        qemu-system-x86 \
        qemu-system-arm \
        sgabios
```

For running Unikraft with networking support, you will also need to configure QEMU to allow network bridge access:

```console
sudo mkdir /etc/qemu/
echo "allow all" | sudo tee /etc/qemu/bridge.conf
```

## Running Applications Using Unikraft

The applications that we will look at are located in [this repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/scripts) (we will use the `scripts` branch for now, not the `main` branch).

Before building and running applications, there are some setup steps we need to do.
First, run the [`./setup.sh` script in the root of the repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/blob/scripts/setup.sh).
This will clone all the dependencies we need.
After that, for every application we will run, we must run the `setup.sh` script from the application directory.

All the applications have a `scripts/` subdirectory where several useful things are located:

* Building scripts, under `scripts/build/`, named `plat.architecture` (we will use `qemu.x86_64` and `qemu.arm64`).
* Running scripts, under `scripts/run/`, same naming convention as the build scripts.
* Configuration files, under `scripts/defconfig/`, we will ignore that for now, and will come back to it in a later session.

### `helloworld` on Unikraft

We will start with the `c-hello` application, which is a simple "Hello, world", written in `C`.

First, we `cd` into the `c-hello` directory and run `./setup.sh`.
This will create a new directory, `c-hello/workdir/`, with all the unikraft-related dependencies.
In order to build and run it as a `x86_64` virtual machine, we need to first run the `scripts/build/qemu.x86_64` script, then `scripts/run/qemu.x86_64`.

```console
git clone https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/
cd catalog-core
git checkout scripts
./setup.sh
cd c-hello/
./setup.sh
./scripts/build/qemu.x86_64 # This might take a while
./scripts/run/qemu.x86_64
```

After the run script, we should see the output of the `hello-world` VM:

```console
SeaBIOS (version 1.16.3-debian-1.16.3-2)

Hello from Unikraft!
```

You can also try the `arm64` scripts:

```console
./scripts/build/qemu.arm64
./scripts/run/qemu.arm64
```

This will emulate an `ARM64` VM and print the application message, similar to the `x86_64` application.

## Work Items

Now that you've seen how to run Unikraft `helloworld`, you can go through the list below, follow the same steps and try more applications.
The steps for running all applications are similar, you run the `setup.sh` script, then `scripts/build/qemu.arch` and `scripts/run/qemu.arch`.
Try to run the foolowing applications for both `x86_64` and `arm64`.

* [`c-html`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/scripts/c-http)
* [`cpp-hello`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/scripts/cpp-hello)
* [`cpp-html`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/scripts/cpp-http)
* [`nginx`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/scripts/nginx)
* [`redis`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/scripts/redis)
* [`python3-hello`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/scripts/python3-hello)

For applications that wait for connections (i.e. `nginx`, `*-http`, `redis`), the VM IP address is `172.44.0.2`.
You can curl `172.44.0.2` for `nginx`, `172.44.0.2:8080` for `*-http`, and you must use [`redis-cli`](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/tools/cli/) for the `redis` application.
To use `redis-cli`, you can use:

```console
redis-cli -h 172.44.0.2
172.44.0.2:6379> PING
PONG
```
