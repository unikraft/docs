title: Using the Application Catalog
description: |
  This guide presents the Unikraft application catalog and how to use it: build and run applications.
  It is meant for anyone interested in using Unikraft and benefiting from technical advantages of unikernels.
---

The Unikraft application catalog is a collection of applications and examples that are built and packaged to run with Unikraft.
The application packages are stored in the Unikraft Application Registry, typically identified by a name similar to those used by [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/): `unikraft.org/node:18`, `unikraft.org/python:3.10`.

The catalog stores both native builds and [binary-compatible](/docs/concepts/compatibility) builds of Unikraft applications.
As a user it shouldn't matter to you.
[KraftKit](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit) is used to provide the same build and run interface for both native and binary-compatible apps.

## Running Applications from the Registry

You can list the applications in the registry by using:

```bash
kraft pkg ls --apps --all --update
```
```

```

The `base` entry is a meta-application that is being used in [binary-compatibility mode](/docs/concepts/compatibility) to run other applications and examples.
The other entries may be binary-compatible or native builds.

To pull and run `helloworld`, for example, use:

```bash
kraft run -W unikraft.org/helloworld
```

This will default to the `x86_64` architecture and to the `qemu` platform.
It will pull and run run the application from the registry:

```
 i  using arch=x86_64 plat=qemu

<Info>
The `-W` option for `kraft run` is used to disable hardware virtualization (KVM).
This is useful if you are running Unikraft applications inside a virtual machine.
If you are running natively (for maximum performance), and if you likely have hardware virtualization support, you can remove the `-W` option.
</Info>

Similarly, we can pull and run Nginx:

```bash
kraft run -W unikraft.org/nginx:1.15
```
```
 i  using arch=x86_64 plat=qemu
[+] pulling unikraft.org/nginx
o.   .o       _ _               __ _
Oo   Oo  ___ (_) | __ __  __ _ ' _) :_
oO   oO ' _ `| | |/ /  _)' _` | |_|  _)
oOo oOO| | | | |   (| | | (_) |  _) :_
 OoOoO ._, ._:_:_,\_._,  .__,_:_, \___)
                 Telesto 0.16.1~b1fa7c5
```

Note that the Nginx server starts but waits for a connection.
In order to connect to it, we need to pass a port mapping, similar to [`docker` commands](https://docs.docker.com/network/#published-ports):

```bash
kraft run -W -p 8080:80 unikraft.org/nginx:1.15
```
```
 i  using arch=x86_64 plat=qemu

<Info>
You can use Nginx version 1.25 instead of version 1.15 by appending `:1.25` to the `kraft run` command.
For example: `kraft run -W unikraft.org/nginx:1.25`
</Info>

With the command above we mapped the local port `8080` to the internal Nginx Unikraft port `80`:
Query the server to get the index page:

```bash
curl localhost:8080
```
```

```

This a local port mapping, running on `localhost`.
For an IP-based network connection, you can use a bridged interface.
First create a bridge interface, as `root` (prefix with `sudo` if required):

```bash
sudo kraft run --network virbr0 unikraft.org/nginx:1.15
```
```
 i  using arch=x86_64 plat=qemu

                 Telesto 0.16.1~b1fa7c5
```

The IP address used is typically the first available address (`172.44.0.2`, if that doesn't work try `172.44.0.3`) so we query the server using that address:

```bash
curl 172.44.0.2
```
```

## The Application Catalog Repository

Application in the registry are built and packaged using the recipes and source code files in the [`catalog` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog).
The `catalog` repository contains two types of entries:

- end-user applications in the [`library/` directory](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/tree/main/library)
- examples in the [`examples/` directory](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/tree/main/examples)

The end-user appplications are built, packaged and published periodically in the registry.

We present the steps to building application and running them locally for:

- [the `nginx/1.25` application](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/tree/main/library/nginx/1.25)
- [the `http-go1.21` example](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/tree/main/examples/http-go1.21)

Both are running in binary-compatibility mode.

For building and running binary-compatible applications, [KraftKit](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) are required.

### NGINX

Follow the steps below to build and run the NGINX binary-compatible application:

1. Set up the BuildKit container, if not already running:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name buildkitd --privileged moby/buildkit:latest
   # CONTAINER_HOST is either docker-container or podman-container, depending on your container environment
   export KRAFTKIT_BUILDKIT_HOST=${CONTAINER_HOST}://buildkitd
   ```

1. Clone the `catalog` repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unikraft/catalog
   ```

1. Enter the application directory:

   ```bash
   cd catalog/library/nginx/1.25
   ```

1. Build the application:

   ```bash
   kraft build --plat qemu --arch x86_64
   ```

1. Run the application with `8080:80` port mapping.:

   ```bash
   kraft run -W -p 8080:80 .
   ```

1. Query the unikernel instance:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

If, instead of port mapping, you want to use bridge networking, follow the steps:

1. As `root` (prefix with `sudo` if required), create a network interface bridge:

   ```bash
   kraft net create -n 172.44.0.1/24 virbr0
   ```

1. Run as `root` (prefix with `sudo` if required):

   ```bash
   kraft run --network virbr0 .
   ```

1. Query the unikernel instance:

   ```bash
   curl http://172.44.0.2
   ```

To close the running `kraft` instance, remove the corresponding `kraft` process.
Run, as `root` (prefix with `sudo` if required):

```bash
kraft rm --all
```

### HTTP Go Server

The NGINX build / run uses a feature called "embedded initrd", that embeds and initial ramdisk with the kernel.
The initial ramdisk contains with the NGINX application binary and depending libraries.
This is generally the case for end-user applications, located in the [`library/` directory](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/tree/main/library).

Another approach is to use a `base` image that is not embedding an actual application.
This is the case for examples, located in the [`examples/` directory](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/tree/main/examples).
The application / example is then passed via an initial ramdisk.
One such example is the [`http-go1.21` example](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/tree/main/examples/http-go1.21).
Follow the steps below to build and run the example:

1. Enter the example directory:

   ```bash
   cd catalog/examples/http-go1.21
   ```

1. Run:

   ```bash
   kraft run -W -p 8080:8080 .
   ```

1. Query the unikernel instance:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

If, instead of port mapping, you want to use bridge networking, follow the steps:

1. As `root` (prefix with `sudo` if required), create a network interface bridge:

   ```bash
   kraft net create -n 172.44.0.1/24 virbr0
   ```

1. Run as `root` (prefix with `sudo` if required):

   ```bash
   # CONTAINER_HOST is either docker-container or podman-container, depending on your container environment
   sudo KRAFTKIT_BUILDKIT_HOST=${CONTAINER_HOST}://buildkitd kraft run --network virbr0 .
   ```

1. Query the unikernel instance:

   ```bash
   curl http://172.44.0.2:8080
   ```

To close the running `kraft` instance, remove the corresponding `kraft` process.
Run, as `root` (prefix with `sudo` if required):

```bash
kraft rm --all
```
