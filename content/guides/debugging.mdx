title: Debugging
description: |
  Unikernels aim to be a more efficient method of virtualization, and this can sometimes cause problems.
  This guide aims to familiarize you with solving problems encountered during the development using GDB.
  This is going to be a more practical guide, with a focus on exercises.

## Reminders

At this stage, you should be familiar with the steps of configuring, building and running any application within Unikraft and know the main parts of the architecture.
Below you can see a list of useful commands.

| Command                                                | Description                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make clean`                                           | Clean the application                                                   |
| `make properclean`                                     | Clean the application, fully remove the `build/` folder                 |
| `make distclean`                                       | Clean the application, also remove `.config`                            |
| `make menuconfig`                                      | Configure application through the main menu                             |
| `make`                                                 | Build configured application (in `.config`)                             |

Today we'll make use of `gdb`.
We recommend the [following cheat sheet](https://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf) for the most common commands.
A quick crash course on GDB may be found [here](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~srhuang/teaching/cmsc212/gdb-tutorial-handout.pdf).

## Debugging

Contrary to popular belief, debugging an unikernel is simpler than debugging a standard operating system.
Since the application and OS are linked into a single binary, debuggers can be used on the running unikernel to debug both application and OS code at the same time.
A couple of things you should know before you get started:

1. In the configuration menu (presented with `make menuconfig`), under `Build Options` make sure that `Drop unused functions and data` is **unselected**.
   This prevents Unikraft from removing unused symbols from the final image and, if enabled, might hide missing dependencies during development.
1. Use `make V=1` to see verbose output for all the commands being executed during the build.
   If the compilation for a particular file is breaking and you would like to understand why (e.g., perhaps the included paths are wrong), you can debug things by adding the `-E` flag to the command, removing the `-o [objname]`, and redirecting the output to a file which you can then inspect.
1. Check out the targets under `Miscellaneous` when typing `make help`, these may come in handy.
   For instance, `make print-vars` enables inspecting at the value of a particular variable in `Makefile.uk`.

### Using GDB

The build system always creates two image files for each selected platform:

* one that includes debugging information and symbols (`.dbg` file extension)
* one that does not

Before using GDB, make sure compiler optimization is turned off: in the configuration menu, go to `Build Options` --> `Optimization level` and select `No optimizations`.
Then, under `Build Options`, select a `Debug information level` that is bigger than 0.
We recommend 3, the highest level.

<Image
      src="/images/debug_information_level.png"
      class="w-auto mx-auto"
      title="Selecting the Debug Level"
      description=""
      position="center"
/>

Once set, save the configuration and build your images.

#### KVM/Qemu

You **must** run the image that does not contain debugging information (as in no `.dbg` extension).
We will use the `.dbg` image with gdb.
We recommend creating the guest in a paused state (the `-S` option):

```console
qemu-system-x86_64 -s -S -nographic -kernel workdir/build/hello-c_qemu-x86_64
```

Note that the `-s` parameter is shorthand for `-gdb tcp::1234`.

Now connect GDB by using the debug image with:

```console
gdb --eval-command="target remote :1234" workdir/build/app-helloworld_kvm-x86_64.dbg
```

**Note:** you will want to run gdb using the `.dbg` command, otherwise you will not have any debugging symbols.

Unless you're debugging early boot code, youâ€™ll need to set a hardware break point.
Hardware breakpoints have the same effect as the common software breakpoints you are used to, but they are different in the implementation.
As the name suggests, hardware breakpoints are based on direct hardware support.
This may limit the number of breakpoints you can set, but makes them especially useful when debugging kernel code.

```console
hbreak [location]
continue
```

You can now run `continue` and debug as you would do normally.

## Work Items

### 01. Tutorial: Use GDB in Unikraft

Build the [`c-hello`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/main/c-hello) application, like you did in the last session.
Enable build messages, attach gdb to the application and toy around.
Break at the `main` function, see if you can make the application print a different message without changing the source code.

### 02. Mystery: Find the secret using GDB

Before starting the task, let's get familiar with some GDB commands.

`ni` - go to the next instruction, but skip function calls

`si` - go to the next instruction, but enters function calls

`c` - continue execution to the next breakpoint

`p expr` - display the value of an expression

`x addr` - get the value at the indicated address (similar to `p *addr`)

`whatis arg` - print the data type of `arg`

GDB provides convenience variables that you can use within GDB to hold on to a value and refer to it later.
For example:

```console
(gdb) set $foo = *object_ptr
```

Note that you can also cast variables in GDB similar to C:

```console
(gdb) set $var = (int *) ptr
```

If you want to dereference a pointer and actually see the value, you can use the following command:

```console
(gdb) p *addr
```

You can find more GDB commands [here](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/gdb-refcard.pdf)
Also, if you are unfamiliar with X86_64 calling convention you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions).

Now, let's get back to the task.
Download the target kernel image from [here](https://github.com/unikraft-upb/guides-exercises/raw/refs/heads/master/debugging/02-secret/mystery_kvm-x86_64.dbg).

Use `qemu` and `gdb` to navigate through the `mystery_kvm-x86_64.dbg` file.

Run the application using the following command:

```console
qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -kernel mystery_kvm-x86_64.dbg -s -S
```

You can attach to it from another terminal using

```console
gdb --eval-command="target remote :1234" mystery_kvm-x86_64.dbg
```

Do you think you can find out the **secret**?

1. Look through the assembly code and see what it does.
   Follow the `test eax, eax` instructions and see what needs to happen to pass those tests and get to the last point where the secret is printed (i.e. be able to advance to address `0x000000000018a4ae`).

1. Investigate memory addresses (using the `x` instruction - such as `x/s $rbp-0x120`), do instruction stepping (`stepi` or `nexti`), use breakpoints (`break *<address>`) and find out the secret.

### 03. Nginx with or without main? That's the question

Let's try a new application based on networking, **Nginx**.

Use the same setup from the last session, follow the instructions in the [`README.md` file from the catalog repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/main/nginx) and build `Nginx` for Qemu/KVM.
Do you observe something strange?
Where is the `main.c` file?

Edit the [`Config.uk` file](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/blob/main/nginx/Config.uk#L14) and remove the `select LIBNGINX_MAIN_FUNCTION` line.
Deselect this `make menuconfig` option `Library Configuration -> libnginx -> Provide a main function` and try to build and run the Nginx application again.
Try to create your own `main.c` file so that the application works again.

In order to add your main file to the build system, you must add it to the `Makefile.uk` file.
Check the [`c-hello Makefile.uk`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/blob/main/c-hello/Makefile.uk) to see an example.

Basically, this exercise has two tasks:

* Build Nginx, as in the previous session
* Nginx without `provide main function`

Hints:

* Use `nm` on the kernel image to see what functions are available.
* Check the files in `workdir/libs/nginx`.
