title: Bincompat Applications
description: |
  Unikraft can be used to run POSIX applications, compiled for Linux, with no aditional changes, using the elfloader
---

We have seen in the previous session how difficult can be to port a simple application to Unikraft.
This is an effort that does not scale well, as we don't want to go through the effort of porting every time we want to use a new application.
Even more, if we want to use a closed-source application, we might not be able to port it since we can not make changes to the source code.

In order to fix this, we ported an [`elfloader` application](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/main/elfloader-basic), that can load a binary application along with it's libraries and run it.
This makes it a lot easier to port applications, since all we have to do is create a filesystem with the application binary and it's required libraries, on our usual Linux setup.

We need to pass the filesystem to the Unikraft application at runtime.
We will do that by creating a `cpio` archive.
Also, we will give the program name that we want to run as an argument to elfloader, using `-append`.

### Run a Simple `helloworld` in Bincompat Mode

Follow the instructions from the `README` file of [`elfloader`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/main/elfloader-basic) and run a simple application.
The application code that will be compiled and run will be placed in `rootfs/`.

### Modify the `helloworld` Applications

Make some changes in the code from `rootfs/`.
Make the application more complex, change it however you want.
You can add more source files, but make sure to add them to the `Makefile`.

### Use Networking in Bincompat Mode

Aplications that need networking will need some extra libraries.
Follow the instructions in the `README` file.
For this, we will use the [`elfloader-net`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core/tree/main/elfloader-net) application.
As in the prevoius sessions, the IP address of the application will be `172.44.0.2`.

### Use a Binary from Your System

Choose an application from your system.
You can use something similar to what we used in the last session, `ls`, `id`, `echo`, `cat`, etc.
Everything that does not have to do with processes should work.
Try as many applications as possible.
If networking is needed, use the `elfloader-net` application as a starting base.
