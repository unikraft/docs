title: Building Dockerfile Images with Buildkit

description: |
  This guide shows how to install buildkit to allow you to build Dockerfile images with Unikraft.
---

Unikraft uses [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/), along with [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/), to construct the root filesystem used by applications.

You can install BuildKit by either running it natively via systemd or in a container.
Please refer to [BuildKit's installation instructions](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) for more information.

To use BuildKit with Docker on your system, you first need to install Docker following the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
This can be either [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

After installing Docker, you can run BuildKit in a container via:

```bash
docker run -d --name buildkitd --privileged moby/buildkit:latest
```

Now instruct `kraft` to use the BuildKit instance from the `buildkitd` container by either setting the environmental variable:

```bash
export KRAFTKIT_BUILDKIT_HOST=docker-container://buildkitd
```

Or edit KraftKit's configuration file at `~/.config/kraftkit/config.yaml` and set the `buildkit_host` attribute.

To check that it worked you can run the following command:

```bash
docker container ps | grep buildkit
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
b146031cd4db   moby/buildkit:latest   "buildkitd"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute      buildkit
```
