It does so in the context of a vibrant community consisting of highly skilled software engineers, researchers, teachers, students and hobbyists.
Periodic meetings, hackathons and a consistent presence in open source events are central to the well functioning of the community.

We use a guidelines for development and maintenance to ensure the creation of high quality code.

Public releases are planned to happen once every two months.
In general, we aim for a public release to happen at the last Monday of each odd month (January, March, May, etc.)

We welcome contributors and users on Discord and on GitHub.
If you are looking for a fun technical project in the area of operating systems, virtualization, come aboard on Discord.
