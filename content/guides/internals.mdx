  We start presenting the modular architecture of Unikraft and how students can build their unikernels using the manual, `make`-based approach.
  Expected time: 100 minutes
---

## Reminder

In the [previous session](/guides/intro), we have experimented with building and running several unikernels using instructions from the `README.md` files of the applications.
Today, we will explore the modular architecture of Unikraft, and how we can leverage that in order to setup, configure, build and run our unikernels from scratch, without the use of scripts or pre-defined configurations.

Let's start by understanding the basic layout of the Unikraft working directory, its environment variables, as well as what the most common Unikraft specific files mean.
We are also going to take a look at how we can build basic applications and how we can extend their functionality and support by adding ported external libraries.

Before everything, we shall take a bird's eye view of what Unikraft is and what we can do with it.
Unikraft is a unikernel [SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit), meaning it offers you the blocks (source code, configuration and build system, runtime support) to build and run unikernels (i.e. applications such as `redis`, `nginx` or `sqlite`).
A unikernel is a single image file that can be loaded and run as a separate running instance, most often a virtual machine.

Summarily, the Unikraft components are shown in the image below:

![unikraft components](/images/unikraft_components.png)

`Unikraft` is the core component, consisting of multiple core / internal libraries (each providing a part of the functionality commonly found in an operating system), the build system, and platform and architecture code.
It is the basis of any unikernel image.
It is located in the [main Unikraft repository](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft).

`Libraries` are additional software components that will be linked against Unikraft for the final image.
There are multiple supported libraries.
Each unikernel image is using its specific libraries.
Libraries are also called **external** libraries, as they sit outside the main Unikraft repository.
They are typically common libraries (such as OpenSSL - a crypto library, or LwIP - a TCP/IP network stack) that have been ported on top of Unikraft.
They are located in specialized repositories in the [Unikraft organization](https://github.com/unikraft/), those whose names start with `lib-`.

`Application` is the actual application code.
It typically provides the `main()` function (or equivalent) and is reliant on Unikraft and external libraries.
Applications that have been ported on top of Unikraft are located in repositories in the [Unikraft organization](https://github.com/unikraft/), those whose names start with `app-`.

An important role of the core Unikraft component is providing support for different platforms and architectures.
A platform is the virtualization / runtime environment used to run the resulting image (i.e QEMU, Firecracker, VMWare etc.).
An architecture details the CPU and memory specifics that will run the resulting image (i.e. x86, ARM).

We can  use a lower-level configuration and build system (based on [Kconfig](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/kbuild/kconfig-language.html) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)) to get a grasp of how everything works.
The low-level system will be further detailed in the next session.

## Setting up Helloworld

It is **heavily** recommended that for building and developing applications with Unikraft, you use a conventional folder structure.
Namely, for the examples that we will be going through in this session, our working directory will look like this:

```console
workdir                     ---> working directory containing applications
`-- helloworld/              ---> application directory
    |
    |
    |-- main.c              ---> application code
    |-- Makefile            ---> makefile for specifying external library dependencies
    |-- Config.uk           ---> unikraft configuration options for the application
    |-- Makefile.uk         ---> the application's compiler flags and source files to build
    |
    |
    `-- workdir/
        |-- libs/        ---> external libraries used by the application
        `-- unikraft/    ---> unikraft core kernel, containing all the internal libraries
`-- nginx/
    |
    |
    |
`-- python3/
    |
    |
    |
...
```

Let's begin with the simplest app there is, `helloworld`.
We first create the `workdir` folder where we will place all of our applications and clone the [`app-helloworld`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld/) repository, which contains the source files and the Makefiles necessary for bulding the `helloworld` application.

```console
$ mkdir workdir

$ cd workdir/

$ git clone https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld helloworld

$ cd helloworld/
[...]

$ ls -F
[...]  Makefile  Makefile.uk  README.md  main.c  [...]
```

Now, while inside the `helloworld/` directory, we create the `workdir/` folder, which will store the Unikraft core kernel from this [repository](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft), along with the `libs/` directory which should store all of the external libraries the applications depends on, cloned from the `lib-` repos of the [Unikraft organization](https://github.com/unikraft/).
Since the `helloworld` application is fairly simple, it does not use any external library, so we can leave the `libs/` directory empty.

```console
$ mkdir workdir/

$ cd workdir/

$ git clone https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft unikraft

$ mkdir libs
```

### Configuration

Now that we have our setup ready, we can head back to the `helloworld/` directory and start configuring our application!

```console
$ cd ../

$ make menuconfig
```

This will open a menu-driven user interface in which you can choose the target architecture, virtualization platform, and configuration options for both internal and external libraries of the resulting unikernel image.

We are met with the following configuration menu. Let's pick the x86 architecture:

![arch selection menu](/images/menuconfig_select_arch.png)

![arch selection menu2](/images/menuconfig_select_arch2.png)

![arch selection menu3](/images/menuconfig_select_arch3.png)

Now, press `Exit` (or hit the `Esc` key twice) until you return to the initial menu.

We have now set our desired architecture, let's now proceed with the platform.
We will choose only the `KVM` platform (press the `Y` key to select it), which is supported by QEMU, the program we will use to launch our virtual machine after compilation:

![plat selection menu](/images/menuconfig_select_plat.png)

![plat selection menu2](/images/menuconfig_select_plat2.png)

For the moment, this is sufficient.
Press the `Save` button and exit the configuration menu by repeatedly selecting `Exit`.

### Building

We can now build our application.
We can do this by simply invoking `make`:

```console
$ make -j$(nproc)
```

This command invokes the build system by compiling the application on `$(nproc)` different threads, for shorter build times.
The compilation process includes all of the Unikraft core internal libraries selected by default for this app, along with the application source files (just `main.c` for `helloworld`).
The process should end with the following output:

```console
[...]
  LD      helloworld_qemu-x86_64.dbg
  UKBI    helloworld_qemu-x86_64.dbg.bootinfo
  SCSTRIP helloworld_qemu-x86_64
  GZ      helloworld_qemu-x86_64.gz
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/X/workdir/helloworld/workdir/unikraft'
```

Notice that each line in `make`'s output consists of an operation in the build process (i.e compiling, linking, symbol striping etc.) and a corresponding generated file.

### Running

Now that the unikernel image has been sucessfully generated, we can finally run it using the QEMU Virtual Machine Monitor:

```console
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel workdir/build/helloworld_qemu-x86_64 -nographic -enable-kvm -cpu host
```

The `-kernel` option is used for indicating the image to be booted by the machine, while the `-nographic` option is simply for using QEMU as a command-line program by redirecting all output to the terminal.

Since [Unikraft v0.17.0 Calypso](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/releases/tag/RELEASE-0.17.0), random number generation is reliant on CPU support. This means that, when using QEMU, one of two options must be enabled:

- You are using QEMU >= 8.0
- You are using hardware acceleration, with KVM

This is why we use `-enable-kvm` and `-cpu host` flags to explictly enable them.
If you are running on other platforms, consider removing them.

```console

Arguments:  "build/helloworld_qemu-x86_64"
```

If everything went well, you should see the beautiful Unikraft banner and the "Hello world" message printed out.
Congratulations!

### Choosing another architecture

Let's try to build the `helloworld` app for the ARM64 architecture, as well.
All you need to do is head back into the configuration menu by running `make menuconfig`, after which you should go to the `Architecture Selection` menu where you can pick the `Armv8 compatible (64 bits)` target.
Make sure to save your changes.
When you exit the menu, you will most likely see this warning message:

```console
*** The following configuration changes were detected:
*** - CPU architecture changed
*** - CPU optimization changed
*** Execute 'make clean' before executing 'make'.
*** This is to ensure that the new setting is applied
*** to every compilation unit.
```

This is a very good recommandation and you'll use it a lot when configuring and building applications - so make sure to run

```console
$ make properclean
```

.
.
.followed by

```console
$ make -j$(nproc)
```

.
.
.to finally build an ARM64 unikernel.
Since we are targeting a different architecture, we have to use QEMU to emulate an ARM64 CPU:

```console
$ qemu-system-aarch64 -kernel build/helloworld_qemu-arm64 -nographic -machine virt -cpu cortex-a57
```

The `-kernel` and `-nographic` are the same as in the x86 case.
The `-machine` option is used to specify which `ARM` board we want to emulate.
We can choose among Raspberry PI, Siemens, NXP boards and so on, but we are instead using the generic platform `virt`, which does not correspond to real hardware and is the board [recommended by QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/arm/virt.html) to run guests.
Lastly, the `-cpu` option is used for specifying the CPU whose ISA we want to emulate.
Some CPUs differ, for example, with regards to the [extensions](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/AArch64-Extensions.html) they implement.
The `cortex-a57` is sufficient for our examples.

If everything went well, you should be greeted by the same Unikraft banner:

```console

                  Atlas 0.13.1~5eb820bd
Hello world!
Arguments:  "helloworld"
```

### Enabling kernel logs

We will now try to further configure our `helloworld` application.
For example, we can try to enable debug messages logged by the kernel to gain a better undersanding of the whole booting process.
You can target either ARM64, or x86 - it's your choice.
We can do this through the same `menuconfig` interface presented earlier, but first, it is recommended that you clean all of the application's build files in order to make sure that the changes are applied correctly.

```console
$ make properclean

make[1]: Entering directory '/home/X/workdir/helloworld/workdir/unikraft'
  RM      build/
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/X/workdir/helloworld/workdir/unikraft'

$ make menuconfig
```

To enable debug messages, we need to configure Unikraft's internal library which handles logging information, `ukdebug`.
To do this, we can proceed to the `Library Configuration` menu:

![library selection menu](/images/menuconfig_select_library.png)

We can then see all of Unikraft's internal libraries listed. Scroll down to `ukdebug`, and hit enter:

![ukdebug select1](/images/menuconfig_select_ukdebug.png)

By default, only error messages are shown.
We want to see all the messages (info, warnings, errors) logged by the kernel.

![ukdebug select2](/images/menuconfig_select_ukdebug_kernel_message.png)

![ukdebug select3](/images/menuconfig_select_ukdebug_kernel_message_all.png)

As before, press the `Save` button and exit the configuration menu by repeatedly selecting `Exit`.

Now, if we build and run the application in the same manner (i.e with `$ make -j $(nproc)`, followed by  `$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel build/helloworld_qemu-x86_64 -nographic`), we should see a more detailed output:

```console
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel build/helloworld_qemu-x86_64 -nographic

You can notice that the debug logs prove to be quite useful: they include information such as timestamp, debugging level (warning, info, error etc.), internal library component (`libkvmpci`, `libukschedcoop` etc.) and the source file along with the line in it.

### Enabling tests

As an exercise, try to enable the `uktest` internal library from the configuration menu.
This should trigger the execution of a suite of tests for some of Unikraft's internal libraries during the booting of the unikernel image.
You should get an output similar to this one:

```console
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel build/helloworld_qemu-x86_64 -nographic
