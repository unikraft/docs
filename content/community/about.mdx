title: Unikraft Open-Source Community
description: |
  Unikraft is developed in the spirit of open source: public discussions on
  Discord, open source licensing model using BSD-3-Clause, public development
  and management on GitHub.

It does so in the context of a vibrant community consisting of highly skilled
software engineers, researchers, teachers, students and hobbyists. Periodic
meetings, hackathons and a consistent presence in open source events are central
to the well functioning of the community.

We use a guidelines for development and maintenance to ensure the creation of
high quality code.

Public releases are planned to happen once every two months. In general, we aim
for a public release to happen at the last Monday of each odd month (January,
March, May, etc.)

We welcome contributors and users on Discord and on GitHub. If you are looking
for a fun technical project in the area of operating systems, virtualization,
come aboard on Discord.
