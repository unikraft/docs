## Project Overview

Unikraft makes it easy to run existing applications in two ways:
1. **Musl libc support**

2. [**Binary-compatibility mode**](https://unikraft.org/docs/concepts/compatibility):
Unikraft can run unmodified Linux ELF binaries by using an ELF loader app and a system-call shim layer.
When a binary-compatible unikernel starts, the app-elfloader parses and maps the ELF segments into memory, then transfers control to the application entry point.
Whenever the application invokes a Linux system call, the syscall shim intercepts the call number and routes it to the corresponding Unikraft handler.
Unimplemented calls return ENOSYS, which many applications can handle or fake because Unikraft follows Linux’s x86_64 ABI closely.
This helps when running on hypervisors like KVM, QEMU, or Firecracker.

## Adding an application in binary-compatibility mode

In the last 3 weeks I continued relying on the same porting procedure described as part of my first blogpost.

## Current Progress


During the first 3 weeks, I worked on `sqlite`, `mosquitto`, `prometheus`, and `consul`.
From weeks 4 to 6, I extended my investigation to ten more applications, identifying why some can’t yet be ported in binary‑compatibility mode and confirming that others work:

1. **etcd**
    - A distributed, reliable key‑value store used for service discovery and configuration.
    - Fails to build in bincompat due to `socket(AF_NETLINK, ...)` not yet supported in Unikraft.

2. **influxdb**
    - A time‑series database optimized for high-write loads and real‑time queries.
    - Also depends on `socket(AF_NETLINK, ...)`, which Unikraft currently lacks.

3. **vault**
    - A secrets management tool for securely storing and accessing tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys.
    - Calls `socket(AF_NETLINK, ...)`, so it cannot be added in bincompat yet.

4. **traefik**
    - A modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer with automatic service discovery.
    - Builds and runs successfully in bincompat mode.
    - Note: the `watch: true` configuration relies on `inotify_init1` and `inotify_add_watch`—this feature isn’t supported yet.
    - Pull request: [catalog#210](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/pull/210)

5. **minio**
    - A high-performance, S3-compatible object storage server.
    - Porting blocked by `socket(AF_NETLINK, ...)` not supported.

6. **gitea**
    - A self-hosted Git service with pull requests, issues, and code review.
    - Uses the `clone` system call without the `CLONE_VM` flag, which Unikraft's posix-process layer doesn't handle.

7. **syncthing**
    - A continuous file synchronization program that keeps files in sync across multiple devices.
    - Makes call to `socket(AF_NETLINK)`, which is not supported.

8. **tomcat**
    - A widely used Java servlet container for running web applications.
    - Depends on file‑backed `mmap(..., MAP_SHARED, ...)` and `socket(AF_NETLINK, ...)`, both not supported.

9. **rabbitmq**
    - A robust message broker implementing the AMQP protocol for distributed systems.
    - Blocked by file-backed `mmap(..., MAP_SHARED, ...)` and `socket(AF_NETLINK)`.

10. **deno**
    - A secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime build on V8 and Rust.
    - Relies on file-backed `mmap(..., MAP_SHARED, ...)`, which isn't currently supported.

Across these weeks, the netlink socket API and shared‑map mmap calls emerged as the main gaps preventing ports of `etcd`, `influxDB`, `vault`, `minIO`, `syncthing`, `tomcat`, `rabbitMQ`, and `deno`.
Gitea’s use of `clone` system call without `CLONE_VM` also needs Unikraft support.
Traefik remains the only one among these that builds and runs, though its inotify‑based watcher will require further work.
I updated the internal [Unikraft community–maintained Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ktTuadF3p428GZKnhchsrr4ElrQqBvG-PPNcCwJdgpM/edit?gid=1739956327#gid=1739956327), which originally only had application names, by adding source links for each app, including catalog apps that weren’t listed before, adding the apps I worked on that were missing, adding remarks about the issues I faced when porting, and keeping the existing catalog links.

## Next Steps

**Week 7**:
I will pick a few more applications from the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ktTuadF3p428GZKnhchsrr4ElrQqBvG-PPNcCwJdgpM/edit?gid=1739956327#gid=1739956327) and try to add them in binary‑compatibility mode.
I’ll follow the same process of building each app, identifying missing syscalls or features, and documenting any issues in the sheet.

**Weeks 8 onwards**: 
I’ll shift focus to core Unikraft.
I plan to work on implementing key features—like netlink sockets, shared‑map `mmap`, `inotify` support, and the missing `clone` flags—that are currently blocking more applications from running in binary‑compatibility mode.
I don’t plan to tackle all missing features at once, but will start with these high‑impact ones.
