Although multithreading is widely adopted in modern software, many foundational applications in the cloud - such as PostgreSQL - continue to rely on multiprocess architectures.
This preference persists not only because of historical design decisions, but also because of practical advantages such as isolation between execution units, easier implementation of scaling, and simplified fault tolerance.
At first glance, this creates a conflict between the traditional unikernel philosophy and real-world requirements, seemingly requiring either the adaptation of multiprocess applications to the multithreaded model, or architectural compromises.

At Unikraft, we see this as a false dichotomy:
While multithreaded applications can benefit from more efficient data usage and faster intercommunication, this approach comes with significant engineering and maintenance overhead for every multiprocess application.
On the other hand, we believe that mass adoption is a critical factor for the success of unikernels in the cloud, and maintain that unikernels and multiprocessing are fundamentally architecturally compatible.
Our vision: Zero[^1] modifications to existing applications' codebases.

Building on this vision, [we are excited to announce that beginning from `0.19.0`](/releases/v0.19.0), Unikraft incorporates  multiprocess capabilities.
Thanks to Unikraft's truly modular architecture, these extensions are optional, non-intrusive, and configurable, preserving Unikraft's minimal nature.
The rest of this post presents the technical aspects of multiprocess support in Unikraft's architecture.

[^1]: Excluding some `fork()` cases that require adaptation, as we will see below.

## POSIX and the challenges of multiprocess

Despite its [many problems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fork-hotos19.pdf), the cornerstone of multiprocess is [`fork(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html).
When a process needs to run another program, it calls `fork()` to create a child process, followed by [execve(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html) to load and run the target executable in the child's context.
One important property of `fork()` is that the parent and child execute on distinct address spaces.
That is a problem for unikernels, that traditionally are single address space operating systems.

One alternative that suits the single address space model is [`vfork(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/vfork.2.html).
`vfork()` first appeared in 3BSD as a workaround for the low performance of `fork()`, given that before [COW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) `fork()` was too slow as the kernel had to copy the parent's context.
In `vfork()`, the child executes at the same address space as the parent until the child calls `execve()` or terminates.
For the sake of consistency, the parent blocks until one of these events occurs.
Moreover, as any change by the child will be eventually visible to the parent, the child is only allowed a limited set of actions:
(1) to update the parent's return value with the child's pid, (2) call `execve()`, and (3) call `_exit()`.
The result of any other behavior is undefined.

Linux introduced the non-standard [`clone(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html) syscall, that included the `CLONE_VFORK` (suspend parent) and `CLONE_VM` (calling process and child shares the same memory space) flags.
With these flags, `vfork()` could be easily implemented by calling `clone()` with flags set to `CLONE_VM | CLONE_VFORK | SIGCHLD`.

[`posix_spawn(3)`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/posix_spawn.3.html) is a libc function that performs the steps required to spawn a new process along with other housekeeping tasks in a safe and performant way.
Because of that, it is the recommended way to spawn a new process.
Under the hood, the various implementation of libc use `fork()`, `vfork()`, or `clone()`.
musl libc [implements `posix_spawn()`](https://github.com/esmil/musl/blob/master/src/process/posix_spawn.c) using `clone()`.
glibc has some interesting history: Until 2.23 it used to provide the `POSIX_SPAWN_USEVFORK` flag to use `vfork()` over `fork()`.
Starting from glibc 2.24, it switched from `vfork()` to `clone()`, and in recent versions `POSIX_SPAWN_USEVFORK` has no effect.
Android's Bionic libc [still honors](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/libc/bionic/spawn.cpp#195) `POSIX_SPAWN_USEVFORK`.

POSIX.1-2001 marked `vfork()` as obsolete in favor of `fork()` with COW and `posix_spawn()`, until it was finally removed in POSIX.1-2008.
Nevertheless, Linux [continues to support](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.11/source/kernel/fork.c#L2879) `vfork()` to this day, and so do the [various](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=vfork) [flavors](https://www.netbsd.org/docs/kernel/vfork.html) of [BSD](https://man.openbsd.org/vfork.2), as `vfork()` remains relevant in systems without an MMU, performance-critical applications, and memory constrained systems.

## The implementation on Unikraft

Given the challenges of `fork()` and Unikraft’s single address space nature, we focus on supporting `posix_spawn`-like workflows, with a conscious decision against any full-fledged `fork()` support.
We believe this strikes the right balance between compatibility and architectural purity.

To enable this, [`libposix-process`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/posix-process) was carefully restructured so that multiprocess capabilities are not intrusive and Unikraft's modular nature is preserved.
The library now offers three granular levels of configuration: (1) Bare minimum process-like behavior for single process applications that execute on a single thread, (2) single process with multithreading, and (3) full multiprocess functionality.
Each configuration adjusts the availability and behavior of syscalls to match its specific usecase.
For more details on the structure of `libposix-process` see [`lib/posix-process/README.md`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/posix-process/README.md).
Also make sure to review the deprecation notice of some Kconfig options resulting from this work, in the [Release Notes of 0.19.0](https://www.notion.so/Blog-Post-Multiprocess-0-19-0-1eeffc0840c480f7b53dff76476a21c7?pvs=21).

### Lifetime management

A large part of the implementation of multiprocess lies on process lifetime management.
As you may have guessed we implement that in Unikraft by adding support to `clone()` for  `CLONE_VM` and `CLONE_VFORK`, along with a `vfork()` syscall implemented as a wrapper to `clone()`.
The implementation of `execve()` relies on the newly introduced [`libukbinfmt`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/ukbinfmt), which is inspired by Linux's binary format handling mechanism of the same name.
Similarly to Linux, it delegates loading and execution of different binary formats to specialized components.
A binfmt handler for ELF is introduced in [`app-elfloader`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader).
Besides `libukbinfmt`, `execve()` requires logic to switch to the new context.
The primitives to achieve that were introduced in Unikraft 0.17.0.
All of the above, together with signals that we present below, enable  Unikraft to support `posix_spawn()`.

The second part in lifetime management is task termination.
That involves `_exit()` that terminates the calling thread, and `exit_group()` that terminates the calling process.
At this point, task resources are released, and the parent can call `wait4()` or `waitid()` to reap the process and obtain its exit status.
In Unikraft, resource management is implemented with events.
Libraries that manage task resources are notified on creation and termination events [^2].
This preserves modularity, and allows creating highly specialized configurations that break the traditional dependencies of POSIX.

[^2]: The list of resources managed for each process in a full implementation is long.
You can get an idea by having a look at the man pages of [`clone(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html) and [execve(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html).

### Signals

Signals are another critical component of multiprocess, although also applicable to single-process workloads.
Signals provide asynchronous communication for coordination (IPC), lifecycle management (the parent receives `SIGCHLD` upon child termination so that it can call `wait()` to reap the child), and error handling (applications can trap signals like `SIGSEGV` and `SIGILL` to handle system faults gracefully).

The implementation involves syscalls for sending signals (`kill()`, `tkill()`, `tgkill()`, `rt_sigqueueinfo()`, `rt_tgsigqueueinfo()`), masking signals (`rt_sigprocmask()`), examining pending signals (`rt_sigpending()`), managing signal disposition (`rt_sigaction()`), examining and changing the stack context of signal handlers (`sigaltstack()`), blocking on signals (`pause()`, `rt_sigsuspend()`, `rt_sigtimedwait()`), signal monitoring based on file descriptors (`signalfd()`, `signalfd4()`), and the list goes on...

The differences between a standard implementation of signals and the one of Unikraft mostly derive from the properties of unikernels:

* There are no privilege checks when sending signals between processes and process groups, as Unikraft is a single-user OS.
* There are no checks on whether the pointers passed to syscalls are part of the process' address space, because Unikraft is operates on a single address space.
* There is no support for the `SIGSTOP` / `SIGCONT` signals, as the are not typical on unikernel workloads.
* And when executing signal handlers, there is no need for the trampoline and [`sigreturn(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigreturn.2.html) mechanism of Linux, as there is no userspace / kernelspace boundary.

In fact, signals in Unikraft are optional even in multiprocess configurations, making the feature truly modular and opt-in, unlike POSIX’s monolithic approach.

### Initialization and shutdown

In traditional *nix systems, process supervision - including intilization and shutdown - traditionally falls under the responsibility of `/sbin/init`, which is spawned as PID 1.

This process is different from all others in that (1) it is created directly by the  kernel and (2) it can never exit.

Since the inception of Unikraft, `libukboot` has provided logic to initialize and cleanup system components via its `inittab`.

As multiprocess workloads cannot be expected to assume the responsibility of init, `libukboot` adds an optional init process that executes that takes care to (1) spawn the *application process* (2) foster orphaned processes (3) reap its children (4) coordinate process termination during shutdown.
Each one of these tasks is described below.

The *application process* is essentially the process that calls `main()`.
That can be an application compiled together with Unikraft into a single binary, or `app-elfloader` that executes an ELF binary object.
Spawning the application process results into the application executing as PID 2.

When a process with children terminates, its chidren are orphaned.
On Linux and other Unix-like operating systems the default is to reparent orphans to `init`.
This scenario often occurs during daemonization, where a process spawns multiple chldren before it proceeds to exit.
`init` is also responsible for reaping its children, whether reparented or not, to ensure that system resources are properly cleaned up.

System shutdown requires termination of all processes before terminating other system components.
This is particularly important for the filesystem, as process need to be terminated and their resources be released before unmounting the filesystem.
For stateful applications, like databases, this is not enough as they need to additionally preserve the consistency of their data at the application level.
Terminating a database process abruptly can result into database corruption.
Unikraft's implementation of `init` provides the possibility of *graceful shutdown*, where `init` signals the application process to give it the opportunity to gracefully terminate itself and its children, before shutting down the system.
The shutdown logic involves additional use-cases like single process, that are out of the scope of this document.
Once again, for details see [`lib/posix-process/README.md`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/posix-process/README.md).

One last thing worth to mention is that in unikernel workloads an `init` process is not always necessary.
Multiprocess applications that manage their children and don't have requirements for persistence can execute without an init.
For that reason, the implementation of `init` that comes with `libukboot` is optional.
That provides multiprocess applications with the flexibility to choose whether they need an init process, or even to replace the default implementation with their own.

## Ending thoughts

Unikraft 0.19.0 lays the foundations for supporting multiprocess applications and runtimes commonly used in modern cloud environments.
Overall the implementation comes with a remarkably small footprint, with the majority of changes concentrated in `libposix-process`, and smaller adaptations in `libukboot` and `app-elfloader`.
From the architecture's perspective the design preserves Unikraft's high level of modularity - not only are all multiprocess components optional, but it's also possible to tailor down the system in ways that break the traditional dependency boundaries imposed by POSIX.

Developers who wish to run multiprocess applications on Unikraft should focus on process creation.
Applications that use `posix_spawn()`, `vfork()` or `clone()` with `CLONE_VFORK | CLONE_VM` should run out of the box.
Those that exclusively rely on `fork()` will require adaptations to use one of the above mechanisms.

While Unikraft 0.19.0 establishes the core multiprocess functionality, we're already working on 0.20.0 that comes several additional features that allow running complex multiprocess applications.
For those curious about what's coming next, here's a sneak peek:
