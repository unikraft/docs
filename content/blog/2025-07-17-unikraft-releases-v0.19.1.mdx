### Catalog Updates

Both the [`catalog`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) and [`catalog-core`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core) repositories have received updates, primarily from the [Community and Development Lab](https://cdl.rosedu.org/) event, from [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) applicants and from [Unikraft Summer Workshop](https://unikraft.org/hackathons/usw25).
Types of updates are:
