## Setup in Unikraft

First of all, I added the following lines to the [lxboot.S](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/releases/tag/RELEASE-0.17.0) file from Unikraft:

```diff
diff --git a/plat/kvm/x86/lxboot.S b/plat/kvm/x86/lxboot.S

This way, if my header is correct and I do indeed reach Unikraft, the guest should hang.

## Starting to debug

There are 2 binary files that are of interest here: `linuxboot.bin` and `linuxboot_dma.bin`.
The `linuxboot.bin` file is optained by compiling [linuxboot.S](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/stable-9.0/pc-bios/optionrom/linuxboot.S) and the `linuxboot_dma.bin` file is optained by compiling [linuxboot_dma.c](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/stable-9.0/pc-bios/optionrom/linuxboot_dma.c).
As you can see, one is written in x86 AT&T assembly and the other is written in C, by using inline assembly.
Naturally, the one written in C would be easier to debug, and luckily, it seems like I do no need the other one.

By adding in [linuxboot.S](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/stable-9.0/pc-bios/optionrom/linuxboot.S) the following code, the QEMU instance should stay in a loop:

```diff
diff --git a/pc-bios/optionrom/linuxboot.S b/pc-bios/optionrom/linuxboot.S
index ba821ab922..26df825db8 100644

```

I observed that nothing changes in its behaviour, so I added the following lines in [linuxboot_dma.c](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/stable-9.0/pc-bios/optionrom/linuxboot_dma.c):

```diff

 );
```

This time the QEMU instance stayed in the loop, so everything was fine.
Now, all I had to do was to change the `jmp` with two `nop` instructions in gdb and from there to start debugging.
Sounds easy, right?

## Unexpected challenges

For some (at the time) unknown reason, when compiling the `.bin` files didn't update.
Was it my fault?
Did I have something wrong with my setup?

After a lot of time, I figured out along with my mentors that I needed to have `gcc-multilib` instead of the one that I had previously.
As different versions of gcc clash (installing one uninstalls the other), I had to replace it.

I observed that there are 3 `linuxboot.bin` and 3 `linuxboot_dma.bin` in the filesystem.
Only one of each was updated when compiling, and it wasn't the one that it searched for by default.
Using `strace`, I figured out that QEMU looks for the `.bin` file in the directory from which the command runs.
Because of this, I copied the `linuxboot_dma.bin` that was updated where I needed it.

## Next steps

I am going to look what and where the problem is inside the `linuxboot_dma.bin` file, using gdb.
Everything took much more than I expected, so I have to do this now.
