As the new year begins, we're excited to show off many of the things the
community has been working over the last two months.  It's become a tradition
now that Unikraft celebrates a new release at [FOSDEM'22](https://fosdem.org/2022/), and we've come a long way since
our initial release at FOSDEM'18.

### New release v0.7 (Mimas)

Unikraft has released [v0.7 (Mimas)](/releases) -- only 2 months after the last!
This is an important milestone for the project as we start to speed up the
reviewing, testing, merging and releasing of components of the Unikraft
ecosystem.  We have come a long way from using patchwork, and have introduced
functionality on top of Github to help with [the project's rigorous review
process](/docs/contributing/review-process/) -- there are a lot of moving parts
which are becoming automated (see the talk on the CI/CD system by below).

Apart from bug fixes, improvements and version updates, Unikraft Release v0.7
Mimas adds core features to support its development and deployment, including:

* [`lib/ukrust`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/ukrust): Internal Rust support, allowing the development of internal libraries in Rust
* [The documentation site](https://unikraft.org) has been revamped with
  extensive information on Unikraft architecture, usage, internals and
  development model.
* Multiple ARM features, such as [SMCCC
  support](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/297), [ns16550
  driver](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/233), [GICv3](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/234) have been
  added.
* Application README files have been updated with detailed instructions on
  configuring, building and running Unikraft applications.

For more details on this release, please check out the [release
page](https://unikraft.org/releases).

#### Unikraft VSCode Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension allowing developers to get the full benefits of
the IDE when working on Unikraft source code.

The Unikraft VSCode Extension extension facilitates the development of Unikraft
applications and libraries (both external and internal).  A big thank you to
[Adina Smeu](https://github.com/adinasm) who was the primary contributor to this
project.
