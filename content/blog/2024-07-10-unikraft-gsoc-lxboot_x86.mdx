As I wrote in the previous blog post, my first objective is to make Unikraft boot on QEMU using the Linux x86 boot protocol.
Here I will present my progress so far and different challenges I faced while working towards my goal.

## Where does QEMU handle the lxboot header?

By using the `git grep` command, I found that `QEMU 9.0.1` handles the Linux x86 boot protocol in the [x86.c](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/stable-9.0/hw/i386/x86.c) file.
Everything happens in the `x86_load_linux` function.

### Fields used by QEMU

These are as follows:

* 0x202: HEADER
* 0x206: VERSION
* 0x211: LOADFLAGS
* 0x236: XLOADFLAGS
* 0x22c: INITRD_ADDR_MAX
* 0x228: CMD_LINE_PTR
* 0x1fa: VID_MODE
* 0x210: TYPE_OF_LOADER
* 0x224: HEAP_END_PTR
* 0x1f1: SETUP_SECTS
* 0x250: SETUP_DATA
* 0x218: RAMDISK_IMAGE
* 0x21c: RAMDISK_SIZE

As you can see, only 13 out of 39 fields are used.
Out of these, 6 are read by QEMU:

* 0x202: HEADER
* 0x206: VERSION
* 0x211: LOADFLAGS
* 0x236: XLOADFLAGS
* 0x22c: INITRD_ADDR_MAX
* 0x1f1: SETUP_SECTS

And 7 are written by QEMU:

* 0x228: CMD_LINE_PTR
* 0x1fa: VID_MODE
* 0x210: TYPE_OF_LOADER
* 0x224: HEAP_END_PTR
* 0x250: SETUP_DATA
* 0x218: RAMDISK_IMAGE
* 0x21c: RAMDISK_SIZE

## Debugging and testing

The application I am using to test the `mklinux_x86.py` file is [app-helloworld](https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld/tree/stable).
By using multiple `printf` and `exit` calls inside the `x86_load_linux` function, I was able to determine the way QEMU uses the header.
Another useful tool was `hexdump`,that was used to look at how my script builds the header.

## Challenges

For starters, I could not figure out why the header created by the script did not align to what QEMU expected.
The problem was that the header, as presented in the documentation, starts at offset `0x1f1`, not `0x0`.
To fix it I had to add 0x1f1 zeros.

Another issue was with integrating it in Unikraft.
Eventually I figured it out, with help from my mentors.

## Integration with Unikraft

Although debugging could be done only by running the `mklinux_x86.py` script and looking at the header, I wanted to test by integrating everything in Unikraft.
For doing this I had to modify the following files: [Linker.uk](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/plat/kvm/Linker.uk), [Config.uk](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/plat/kvm/Config.uk) and [Makefile.rules](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/plat/common/Makefile.rules).

## Next steps

At the moment, when I try to run, it loops indefinitely.
I have to debug and find out what does not work.

Additionally I am going to look into SeaBIOS/qboot/GRUB2 to see how the jumping to the kernel happens and I will write the needed 16-bit and 32-bit assembly stubs.
