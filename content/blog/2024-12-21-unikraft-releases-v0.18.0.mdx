We are proud to announce a new version of Unikraft: `v0.18.0`.

This release comes packed with features related to security, virtual filesystem and general application support.
It contains plenty of fixes that improve the stability and application support of Unikraft.

In this blog post, we present the new features available in Unikraft.
For a full breakdown, please check out the [changelog](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/compare/RELEASE-0.17.0...RELEASE-0.18.0).

### Integrated Debug Support with GDB Stub

_This feature was championed by [Thassilo Schulze](https://github.com/thass0) with great support from [Michalis Pappas](https://github.com/michpappas) and [Simon Kuenzer](https://github.com/skuenzer).

Unikraft `v0.18` introduces native support for GDB, allowing developers to debug applications and system-level code seamlessly, even on Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) and hypervisors that don't offer built-in debug facilities.
Debugger support is provided by an implementation of a GDB stub within `libukdebug`, which enables direct communication with a GDB client over a serial connection.
For more information on enabling and confguring the GDB stub see [libukdebug's README.md](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/ukdebug/README.md).

### Abstraction for Console Devices

_This feature was championed by [Thassilo Schulze](https://github.com/thass0) with great support from [Michalis Pappas](https://github.com/michpappas) and [Simon Kuenzer](https://github.com/skuenzer).

The newly introduced `libukconsole` provides an abstraction layer for consoles.
The implementation of `COM` for `x86_64` has been merged with the `ns16550` driver, and all console drivers have been updated to implement the `ukconsole` driver API.
This is a long anticipated feature that allows efficient management of console devices, and enables the addition of new features, with the GDB stub being the first one to utilize this subsystem.

### Further improvements of libukrandom

_This feature was championed by [Michalis Pappas](https://github.com/michpappas) with great support from [Alex Apostolescu](https://github.com/Alex-deVis), [Maria Pana](https://github.com/mariapana), [Simon Kuenzer](https://github.com/skuenzer), and [Stefan Jumarea](https://github.com/StefanJum)._

This release continues on the improvents introduced in Unikraft `v0.17` for cryptographically secure randomness.
`libukrandom` now includes a driver API, and the implementation of CPU-generated randomness has been reworked into conforming drivers.
For more flexibility, the driver API introduces fallback operations: On x86_64, `RDSEED` can now fall back to `RDRAND`, addressing common issues faced by users running on legacy machines without `RDSEED` support, or those using TCG emulation on older versions of QEMU.

In addition to the above, it is now possible to seed the CSPRNG via Unikraft's command-line, or through the device tree blob.

Finally, the CSPRNG has been updated to now use 20 rounds (ChaCha20), and an implementation of the test vectors of [RFC8439](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8439) is available to execute via `libuktest`.

For more info see the new documentation at [drivers/ukrandom/lcpu](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/drivers/ukrandom/lcpu/README.md) and [lib/ukrandom](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/ukrandom/README.md).

### Early Initialization Framework

_This feature was championed by [Michalis Pappas](https://github.com/michpappas) with great support from [Andrei Stan](https://github.com/andreistan26),  [Oleksii Moisieiev](https://github.com/oleksiimoisieiev), [Sergiu Moga](https://github.com/mogasergiu), and [Simon Kuenzer](https://github.com/skuenzer).

`libukboot` introduces `earlytab`, a lightweight framework for early initialization.
This complements the existing `inittab`, with specific focus on the initialization of early devices and their dependencies.

`libuklibparam` has been refactored to allow command-line parsing during early initialization.
This additionally fixes a limitation of the previous registration mechanism where all parameters had to be registered from a single file.
`libuklibparam` is assigned the highest (earliest) priority, to ensure that drivers and libraries in subsequent stages have access to Unikraft's command-line parameters.
Notice that for the time being this has the side-effect of information printed by `libuklibparam` to be lost, as `earlycon` is registered to a later priority.
This will be resolved once `libukprint` is introduced, as that library will provide a console buffer.

Initialization of early devices have been migrated to `earlytab`.
Serial console drivers are updated to register with `earlytab` when early console support is enabled.
Similarly, drivers that provide secure randomness initialize `libukrandom` at early init, to fulfil the requirement of security-critical mechanisms for early randomness.

Overall, the introduction of `earlytab` marks a significant step towards a unified and coordinated initialization process, which is a requirement for upcoming features.
Most notably, `earlytab` will eventually replace the intermediate jump from boot code to platform-specific initialization, with platforms being able to register initialization calls directly with `earlytab`.
Early adopters of this mechanism in this release are the UART and VGA console devices of KVM, and the hypervisor console of Xen.

### Statistics for libuksched and libukfalloc

_This feature was championed by [Michalis Pappas](https://github.com/michpappas)_ with great support from [Cezar Craciunoiu](https://github.com/craciunoiuc), [Florin Postolache](https://github.com/flpostolache), and [Simon Kuenzer](https://github.com/skuenzer).

Following previous work on `libuknetdev`, this release comes with updates on`libusched` and `libukfalloc` to export statistics that provide insight on the performance and overall behavior of the system.

`libuksched` defines the set of statistics that a given scheduler implementation should provide.
Metrics include the number of schedules, yields, context switches to processes and the idle thread.
The cooperative scheduler implementation, `libukschedcoop`, has been updated to export these metrics.

Similarly, `libukfalloc` has been updated to define a set of per-instance as well as system-wide statistics.
The buddy implementation, `libukfallocbuddy`, is updated to export these statistics where needed.

In both cases, statistics are provided via the `libukstore`.
For For a general descriptions on how to access the exported stats, see the documentation of `libukstore` at [lib/ukstore/README.md](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/ukstore/README.md).

### Known issues

* [QEMU 9 doesn't boot C HTTP program on Ubuntu `22.04`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/issues/1557)
* [lib/ukallocbuddy: Boot error message for Nginx (QEMU, KVM, x86_64)](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/issues/1505)
* [plat/kvm does not boot on Firecracker `0.10.0-dev` on arm64](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/issues/1488)

### Catalog Update

We updated the [application `catalog`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) with multiple application runtimes, including MariaDB, MongoDB, Java, Grafana, Zig.
The application catalog hosts application runtimes and examples running with Unikraft.
Generally, we use [KraftKit](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit) as the tool to build and run unikernel images for these applications.

### `catalog-core` - A Catalog for Core Developers, Reviewers, Testers and Maintainers

[`catalog-core`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog-core) is a catalog of Unikraft applications that are set up, configured, built and run using first principles tools: Make, GCC, Clang, KConfig, QEMU, Firecracker, Xen; that is, not using KraftKit.
Each directory belongs to a given application and it typically consists of source code, `Makefile`, `Makefile.uk`, filesystem and a `README.md` file with instructions.

`catalog-core` is targeted towards Unikraft core developers (i.e. developers of the [`unikraft` core repository](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft) or [library repositories](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alibrary+org%3Aunikraft&type=Repositories)), maintainers, testers and those who want to learn about the internals of Unikraft.
Application and tooling developers and general users should use the [official `catalog` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog).

`catalog-core` current consists of an initial set of applications to be built and run using first principles tools.
It also contains scripts to automate the building, running and testing of applications, Unikraft core and libraries.

### Community Activities

#### OmniOpenCon 2024

As part of [OmniOpenCon 2024](https://omniopencon.org/), we organised a workshop, where the participants took some first steps into building and running an application using Unikraft.

We also had a talk beforehand, `Efficient, Effective and Fun Computing with Unikernels`, demonstrating how easy it is to build, package, run and deploy common applications with Unikraft, focusing on two primary areas: cloud computing and embedded development.

OmniOpenCon 2024 also hosted an open source hackathon, with about 20 participants, with some working on Unikraft.

#### Unikraft Summer Workshop 2024

[Unikraft Summer Workshop 2024 (_USW'24_](https://unikraft.org/hackathons/usw24) is a **free and virtual** workshop held by members of the Unikraft community.
It focuses on cloud-native applications and on the unikernel technology that powers efficient and high performance cloud deployments.

The three-week event holds a number of starter tutorials and workshops on how to configure, build, run, deploy and debug cloud applications using Unikraft.

This year, we had 11 students that took part in the Unikraft Summer Workshop.
At the end of the three-week event, we organised a hackathon, were the students were able to contribute to the project.

#### Vienna Unikraft Workshop

On December 708, 2024, we organised the [Vienna Unikraft Workshop](https://unikraft.org/hackathons/2024-12-vienna), together with [SBA Research](https://www.sba-research.org/).
The workshop took place as an in-person event, at `SBA Research`.
Members of the Unikraft community were there, as well as our hosts from `SBA Research`.

We spent the first day getting people accustomed to the Unikraft project, following some guides in order to build, run and deploy cloud applications.

The second day was focused on participants contributing to the projects, porting new applications, finding and fixing issues, etc.
During this, [`Tor`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/pull/146) and [`Zero MQ`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/pull/147) were ported, and several other issues were found and fixed.

#### GSoC 2024

As part of Google Summer of Code 2024, Unikraft had 5 projects approved.
We've had 16 application, out of which 5 were selected.

The 5 projects are:
