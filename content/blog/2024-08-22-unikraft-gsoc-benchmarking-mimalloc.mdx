title: "GSoC'24: Benchmarking mimalloc"
description: |
  Different applications have different memory usage patterns and perform better
  when using dedicated memory allocators. Right now, the buddy allocator is the only
  available memory allocator used in Unikraft, so this GSoC project aims to 
  port more memory allocators to it, starting with mimalloc.

## Project Overview

### Memory allocation in Unikraft

Memory allocators have a significant impact on application performance.
There have been some [research papers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/378795.378821) which compared different memory allocators.
According to their work, Switching to the appropiate memory allocator may improve the application performance by 60%.
Unikraft currently supports only one general-purpose memory allocator, the buddy allocator.
This project aims to port [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) (pronounced "me-malloc"), a high-performance general-purpose memory allocator developed by Microsoft, to Unikraft.
This is the first step in a series of efforts to provide Unikraft users with more memory allocators to choose from to enhance the performance of their applications.

### Objectives

[Hugo Lefeuvre](https://github.com/hlef) made an initial work to port mimalloc to Unikraft back in 2020 (see [this repo](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-mimalloc)).
However, as Unikraft has evolved significantly over the years, more work has to be done in order to adapt the `lib-mimalloc` port to the latest Unikraft core.

So far, I have successfully ported the mimalloc memory allocator to Unikraft, marked by a successful compilation of mimalloc `v1.6.3` against the latest Unikraft core (v0.17.0) with `lib-musl`.
Now, I am focused on validating the functionality and benchmarking the performance of the allocator.
The next step would be to port the latest mimalloc (v2.1.7) to the latest Unikraft version (v0.17.0).

## Current Progress

These past three weeks, I have successfully ran the `cache-scratch` and `cache-thrash` benchmark using the *mimalloc* memory allocter, which uses MUSL's `pthread` interface for multithreading.

### Debugging weird behaviours with multithreading

It was not without a hassle to get `pthread` working.
We had originally used [this test app](https://gist.github.com/mikesart/7c915b20df4af2cad7f0d0375be2d208) to test the creating and joining of threads.
However, we quickly ran into a confusing bug during boot time:

```console
[    1.662513] CRIT: <init> [libposix_process] <clone.c @  445> Assertion failure: (*({ __uptr _curr_tlsp = ukplat_tlsp_get(); __sptr _offset; typeof(cl_uktls_magic) *_ref; do { if ((__builtin_expect((!!(!((child)->flags & (0x004)))), 0))) { do { if (((0
```

This assertion failure is telling us that our TLS memory region is not initialized properly, and thus the magic value does not equal what we should have set during initialization.
I have tried to add break points and followed along the TLS initialization process during boot time, but did not find any significant defficiencies.
It was after a four-hour long debug session with [@mogasergiu](https://github.com/mogasergiu) that we found out that for some unknown reason, the `cl_uktls_magic` value will be corrupted if we declare any TLS array greater than 15 bytes in size.
We suspect that this is either an issue with the program linker - which should generate a variable offset for the TLS variables relative to the `fs` register at compile time - or with us that we simply did not initialize the `fs_base` register correctly.
I have opened [an issue](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/issues/1478) addressing this.

### Running `cache-scratch` and `cache-thrash`

After resolving the above bug, we finally got `cache-scratch` (and its brother `cache-thrash`) up and running!
This is one great milestone for the project as this is the first time we have gotten *mimalloc* to run in a multithreaded environment!
Or, at least we think so.

### Running *mimalloc* in an SMP environment

After running the benchmarks under multiple configurations, we noticed that *mimalloc* did not perform significantly better than the existing *binary buddy* allocator.
In fact, in many cases, its performance was even worse than its competitor.
This is not an surprising result, though, because we are not running the virtual machine with SMP enabled, so *mimalloc* would have wasted much time on unnecessary synchronization.
Therefore, to really benchmark the performance of *mimalloc* (and to justify Unikraft's potential for full SMP support), we need to get it running with real parallelism.

Running *mimlloc* in a real SMP environment is not as easy as setting `CONFIG_UKPLAT_LCPU_MAXCOUNT` in Unikraft's configuration and specifying `-smp <N>` when launching QEMU.
Some other considerations are:

1. Unikraft's virtual memory interface (`ukvmem`) is not synchronized, so we have to initialize the entire memory region at boot time (as opposed to lazy-load them) to avoid concurrent page faults (note that Unikraft does not support swapping yet)
1. Because *mimalloc* uses the `pthread` interface (specifically, `pthread_key_create` which is a synchronized call), we have to manually initialize a scheduler (the non-synchronous `ukschedcoop`) on each secondary CPU before we run any function that may yield to the scheduler on them.
1. Do we need to access TLS variables on secondary CPUs?
If so, we would also need to initialize the TLS memory region on them.

If we zoom out a bit here, though, the main challenge becomes clear: how do we coordinate all of Unikraft's core components — some synchronized, some not - to work together in support an SMP application?
Without a holistic view of how each part interacts with each other, in what order they are initialized, etc.,
we will simply keep bumping into more and more chicken-egg problems and the like.

## Next steps

Next up, I will keep working on setting up *mimalloc* for an SMP environment.
Once that is done, I will apply [this patch that synchronized the *buddy* allocator](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/946/commits/ba6cb5dac2003812f972ef102a5c2bc935648fe3) and compare their performance on the benchmarks.
In the future, I plan to port more sophisticated benchmarks to test the allocators, refine the port and Unikraft's synchronization support in general, and ultimately, have the *mimalloc* allocator run on a real industry-level application like Redis.
Although my GSoC project is ending, the journey toward full synchronization support for Unikraft is far from over.
