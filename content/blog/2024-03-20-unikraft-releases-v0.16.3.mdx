We are proud to announce the latest version of Unikraft, v0.16.3!

This is a fix release, primarily focused on fixes, documentation updates and the addition of new applications.

### Application Catalog

_This feature was championed by [Felipe Huici](https://github.com/felipehuici) and [Răzvan Deaconescu](https://github.com/razvand) with feedback from [Ștefan Jumărea](https://github.com/StefanJum) and [Mihnea Firoiu](https://github.com/Mihnea0Firoiu)._

The [`catalog`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) has been populated with additional applications and examples.
This has been complemented by updates to documentation, both in the form of website updates and `README` updates in the catalog entries.

Feel free to try existing applications and examples and add your own to the catalog.

### Documentation and Website Updates

_This feature was championed by [Felipe Huici](https://github.com/felipehuici) and [Alexander Jung](https://github.com/nderjung) with feedback from [Răzvan Deaconescu](https://github.com/razvand)._

Documentation and [website](https://unikraft.org/) layout have been updated to focus more on the [application `catalog`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog).
We fixed missing links, made corrections to guides, revamped the landing page, added application icons.

### Community Activities

#### Monthly Hackathon

We continue organizing monthly hackathons, generally taking place in the last Saturday of each month.
Hackathons take place both online and in person, generally at the National University of Science and Technology POLITEHNICA of Bucharest.

We organized a monthly hackathon on Saturday, March 2, 2024.
It was targeted on the 0.16.3 release, focused on documentation and [`catalog`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) updates.
Main outcomes of the hackathon were:

* the archiving of old `app-...` repositories and referencing the [`catalog`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) repository
* updates to instructions related to publishing the [`docs`](https://github.com/unikraft/docs) repository (used as the backing store for the [website](https://unikraft.org/))
* testing and fixes in the [`catalog`](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) repository

The next monthly hackathon is scheduled to take place on Saturday, March 30, 2024.
