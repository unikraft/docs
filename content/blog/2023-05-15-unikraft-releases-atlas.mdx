Unikraft v0.13.0 (Atlas) is out!

As usual, this release adds important fixes and comes with a bunch of new features!

In this blog post, we describe some of the new features available in Unikraft.
For a full breakdown, please check out the [changelog](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/compare/RELEASE-0.12.0...RELEASE-0.13.0).


## New Synchronization Primitives ([#476](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/476))

_This feature began as a [Google Summer of Code 2022 (GSoC22) project](https://github.com/unikraft/gsoc/blob/staging/gsoc-2022/ideas.md#smp-synchronization), and it was championed by [Sairaj Kodilkar](https://github.com/Sairajkodilkar) under the guidance of [Marc Rittinghaus](https://github.com/marcrittinghaus) and [Andra Paraschiv](https://github.com/andraprs) with support from [Radu Nichita](https://github.com/RaduNichita) and [Răzvan Deaconescu](https://github.com/razvand)._

The release introduces an IRQ-safe API for spinlocks as well as an SMP-safe mutex and semaphore implementation.
Previously, mutexes and semaphores only disabled interrupts for synchronization, which limited these primitives to uniprocessor systems.
The new SMP-safe implementation uses atomic operations and spinlocks instead, making them ready for use in multicore environments.
This is an important step towards full multicore support in Unikraft and part of our effort to introduce proper synchronization to the various Unikraft core libraries and subsystems. Along with this improvement, mutexes are changed to be non-recursive by default;
this is to discourage the use of recursive synchronization, which usually increases complexity and is an indication of poor design.
In addition, this allows possible future optimizations of the mutex implementation.

While _correct_ synchronization is a complex topic in and of itself, achieving good performance scalability with increasing numbers of cores is even more challenging.
To this end, developers need to be able to choose from a wide range of synchronization methods and SMP-safe data structures.
This release adds SMP-safe reader-writer locks to `uklock`'s repertoire of synchronization primitives.
Reader-writer locks control access to a shared resource by allowing multiple readers or a single writer at a time, ensuring concurrent read operations and exclusive write operations.
Employing reader-writer locks is thus more efficient for sychronizing data structures that, on average, experience more parallel reads than writes, for example when iterating over a list of virtual memory areas to resolve page faults.

## Native Firecracker VMM Support ([#760](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/760))

_This feature was championed by [Marco Schlumpp](https://github.com/mschlumpp) with important input from [Marc Rittinghaus](https://github.com/marcrittinghaus), [Sergiu Moga](https://github.com/mogasergiu) and [Andrei Topala](https://github.com/Krechals)._

**⚠️ This addition results in a breaking change to Unikraft's output binary artifact name.**

This release introduces support for booting Unikraft on the Firecracker VMM.
Compared to QEMU, this enables even faster boot times for Unikraft unikernels.
This support was built on top of the boot code refactoring in the previous release, and therefore shares most of the code with the multiboot entry point used with QEMU.

Please note that currently Unikraft's virtio drivers do not work with Firecracker. This will be addressed with a future release.

Previously, when building for x86_64 and targeting KVM, the resulting binary artifact would be output, in the case of the helloworld application, as `helloworld_kvm-x86_64`.
The new artifact name now includes the target VMM, so the result will be `helloworld_qemu-x86_64`, or `helloworld_fc-x86_64` in the case of Firecracker.


## `posix-environ`: Handling Environmental Variables ([#868](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/868))

_This feature was championed by [Simon Kuenzer](https://github.com/skuenzer) with support from [Răzvan Deaconescu](https://github.com/razvand), [Eduard Mihăilescu](https://github.com/Starnox) and [Job Paardekooper](https://github.com/jobpaardekooper)._

This release introduces the handling of environment variables with the `posix-environ` library.
The environment variables vector `environ` can be populated at compile time and at runtime if  `uklibparam` is configured as part of a build.
The library provides POSIX-conformant getters and setters, like `getenv()` and `setenv()`.

The variables provided at compile-time are configurable with `make menuconfig` under `Library Configuration --> posix-environ --> Compiled-in environment variables`.
16 slots are available and the initial `environ` vector is created with the filled slots.

Additionally, the configuration option `Parse kernel command line arguments` enables setting further initial environment variables via the kernel command line.
In this mode, the parameter `env.vars` accepts an array of strings that is appended to the compile-time initialized vector.

As example, the following command line snippet sets the variables `PATH`, `UID`, `GID`, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib`:

```text
env.vars=[ "PATH=/bin" "UID=0" "GID=0" "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib" ] --
```


## Rewriting `uklibparam` ([#867](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/867))

_This feature was championed by [Simon Kuenzer](https://github.com/skuenzer) with input from [Alexander Jung](https://github.com/nderjung) and [Răzvan Deaconescu](https://github.com/razvand)._

Unikraft's library parameter parser was originally rewritten to provide support for environment variables via the kernel command line (see [`posix-environ`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/posix-environ)).

Besides ensuring an allocation-free and TLS-free implementation for early boot code, `uklibparam` now relies on pre-processed argument vectors, as with `ukargparse`.
This avoids duplicated processing of quotes while naturally enabling support for single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), and nested quoting.
Also, arrays of strings are supported by this release.

A new set of registration macros simplifies the registration process and introduces the ability to specify a description that is displayed with the `help` kernel command:

```text
Usage of command line:
   [help] [PREFIX.PARAMETER=VALUE]... -- [APPLICATION ARGUMENT]...

Special commands:
        help                   Print this help summary

Available parameters:
         env.vars              Environment variables (array[8] of charp)
         vfs.rootfs            rootfs (charp)
         vfs.rootdev           rootdev (charp)
         vfs.rootopts          rootopts (charp)
         vfs.rootflags         rootflags (u64)

Numbers can be passed in decimal, octal ("0" as prefix), or hexadecimal ("0x" as prefix).
Valid boolean values for 'true' are: "true", "on", "yes", a non-zero number.
Valid boolean values for 'false' are: "false", "off", "no", a zero number (e.g., "0").
Boolean parameters that are passed without a value will be set to 'true'.
Array parameters can be passed with multiple 'PREFIX.PARAMETER=VALUE' tokens,
using a list: 'PREFIX.PARAMETER=[ VALUE0 VALUE1 ... ]', or a combination of both.
Please refer to the application manual or application help for application arguments.
```

To use this, a library only needs to include `uk/libparam.h`, declare the variables, and register those with `uklibparam`.
The following example demonstrates how this is done with C code:

```clike
#include <stddef.h> /* NULL */
#include <uk/libparam.h>

/* Declarations with default values */
static char *myvar="My parameter";
static char *myvec[4]={ NULL };

/* Registration to uklibparam
 * NOTE: The macro automatically removes the registration if
 *       lib/uklibparam is excluded from the configuration.
 */
UK_LIBPARAM_PARAM(myvar, charp, "My variable");
UK_LIBPARAM_PARAM_ARR(myvar, charp, 4, "My C-string vector");
```

The following command line snippet sets the variables `myvar` and `myvec`:

```text
mylib.myvar="Banana" mylib.myvec=[ "I" "am" "very" "hungry!" ] --
```

Alternatively, arrays can be filled with multiple tokens or a combination of array syntax and tokens; for example:

```text=
mylib.myvar="Banana" mylib.myvec="I" mylib.myvec="am" mylib.myvec=[ "very" "hungry!" ] --
```

## `app-elfloader` Updates

_This work was championed by [Simon Kuenzer](https://github.com/skuenzer) with extensive support from [Andra Paraschiv](https://github.com/andraprs), [Cosmin Vancea](https://github.com/csvancea) and [Răzvan Deaconescu](https://github.com/razvand)._

This release includes updates that enhance and simplify the use of [`app-elfloader`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader).
`app-elfloader` is used to run unmodified Linux ELFs with Unikraft, via the [`syscall_shim`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/syscall_shim).

The `README.md` file has been updated with detailed instructions on configuring, building, running and debugging `app-elfloader`.
A helper debugger script allows the use of debugging symbols in the application, in the loader and in the standard C library.

For dynamic applications, explicit loading of the Linux dynamic linker / loader was required.
Recent updates don't require that, and the path to the actual dynamic ELF can be passed to the running Unikraft instance.
`app-elfloader` parses the `.interp` section to obtain information about the dynamic linker / loader, typically located in `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so` on a typical Linux system.
The dynamic linker / loader, which needs to be part of the filesystem of the running Unikraft instance, is then loaded and invoked to load dependent libraries and to do dynamic symbol resolution.

Up until now, the executable (or the explicit dynamic linker / loader) was passed as part of the initial ramdisk, using the `-initrd` argument of the `qemu-system` command.
With these recent changes, the executable can be part of the running instance's filesystem.
The filesystem path is passed as an argument when running `app-elfloader`.
Finally, executing applications is now simplified by using the companion [`run-app-elfloader` repository], consisting of wrapper scripts and pre-built images.


## Application Compatibility Updates

_The work under this banner is the result of continuous effort from [Marc Rittinghaus](https://github.com/marcrittinghaus), [Simon Kuenzer](https://github.com/skuenzer), [Răzvan Deaconescu](https://github.com/razvand), [Ioan Țeugea](https://github.com/John-Ted), [Florin Postolache](https://github.com/maniatro111), [Andra Paraschiv](https://github.com/andraprs), [Marco Schlumpp](https://github.com/mschlumpp) and [Cosmin Vancea](https://github.com/csvancea)._

Multiple applications are tested using the binary-compatibility mode, i.e. running unmodified Linux ELFs on top of Unikraft, by trapping in the [Unikraft `syscall_shim`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/syscall_shim);
this is done using [`app-elfloader`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader).
ELFs must be PIE (_Position-Independent Executables_).
Two repositories store pre-built applications: [`dynamic-apps`](https://github.com/unikraft/dynamic-apps) and [`static-pie-apps`](https://github.com/unikraft/static-pie-apps), for dynamic and static PIE apps, respectively.

Running these applications revealed (1) incompatibilities between the Linux ABI expected by applications and Unikraft and (2) incomplete, missing or faulty system calls; both issues are now fixed.
Applications in the [`dynamic-apps`](https://github.com/unikraft/dynamic-apps) and [`static-pie-apps`](https://github.com/unikraft/static-pie-apps) repositories are now working with Unikraft by employing [`app-elfloader`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader).

As part of the effort, the [`dynamic-apps` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/dynamic-apps) was created.
And the [`static-pie-apps` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/static-pie-apps) was enriched with new applications.
Focus is on dynamic PIE apps, since they are the default applications on Linux distributions;
they can simply be picked up, together with dependent libraries, configuration files and support files, and provided inside a filesystem to be run with Unikraft by using [`app-elfloader`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader).

Existing applications can be quickly tested by using the companion [`run-app-elfloader` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/run-app-elfloader):

```console
$ ./run_app.sh
Usage: ./run_app.sh [-l] <app>
Possible apps:
bc bc_static bzip2 client client_go client_go_static client_static echo gzip
gzip_static haproxy helloworld helloworld_cpp helloworld_cpp_static
helloworld_go helloworld_go_static helloworld_rust helloworld_rust_static_gnu
helloworld_rust_static_musl helloworld_static ls nginx nginx_static openssl
python redis redis7 redis_static server server_go server_go_static
server_static sqlite3 sqlite3_static
    -l - use dynamic loader explicitly

$ ./run_app.sh helloworld
[...]
Hello, World!
```

## Newlib Support in the Latest Unikraft Version

_This feature was championed by [Eduard Vintilă](https://github.com/eduardvintila), with support from [Maria Sfîrăială](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala), [Răzvan Deaconescu](https://github.com/razvand) and [Teodor Țeugea](https://github.com/John-Ted)._

Since the introduction of [Musl](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl) as the default standard C library (_libc_) for Unikraft, in [release 0.11.0](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/releases/tag/RELEASE-0.11.0), [Newlib](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-newlib) support was deprioritized.
With this release, Newlib support is now updated to the most recent Unikraft version.

[Updates to `lib-newlib`](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-newlib/pull/28) and [to the companion threading library `lib-pthread-embedded`](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-pthread-embedded/pull/11) were related to the recent updates of Unikraft and `lib-lwip`: new scheduling API, Musl-imported functions, timing.

Most [Unikraft application repositories](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aunikraft-application+org%3Aunikraft&type=Repositories) are currently configured to use, by default, [Musl](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl), though they can be configured to use [Newlib](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-newlib) instead.


## Documentation Updates

_This feature was championed by [Ștefan Jumărea](https://github.com/eduardvintila), with extensive support from [Radu Nichita](https://github.com/RaduNichita), [Maria Sfîrăială](https://github.com/mariasfiraiala), [Răzvan Deaconescu](https://github.com/razvand), [Delia Pavel](https://github.com/DeliaPavel) and [Eduard Vintilă](https://github.com/eduardvintila)._

As usual with every release, we have significantly updated our documentation.
Most of the updates have to do with documenting existing features that has little or sometimes no docmentation, and were often driven by support for hatckathon and tutorial events.

Documentation updates are pushed to the [core `unikraft` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft) and in the [`docs` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/docs) repos -- the latter also stores website information.

In the [core `unikraft` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft), documentation consists of (1) `README.md` files in internal libraries, such as [`vfscore`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/vfscore/README.md); and (2) Doxygen-style comments in header and source code files, such as [`ramfs`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/ramfs/ramfs.h), that are then exported (or will be) to Unikraft's website, as official API documentation.

For the [`docs` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/docs), most changes consist of updates to [hackathon sessions](https://unikraft.org/community/hackathons/sessions/) for the hackathons taking place during this time.
Two important additions to documentation are related to [binary compatibility](https://unikraft.org/docs/usage/bin_compat/) and to [building and running complex applications](https://unikraft.org/docs/usage/make_build/#building-and-running-complex-applications-with-make).


## Community Activities


### Full Day Hackathon at UPB in March

We took the time to do another full day hackathon! The hackathon took place on 11th of March 2023.
Everyone interested could join us in-person, at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, and online, on our [Discord server](https://bit.ly/UnikraftDiscord).

We had all kind of community members joining, from beginners to more experienced people, adding features, reviewing, debugging or making their first steps in Unikraft.
And the project provided the all essential pizza :)
