  The easiest way to build, package and test your unikernel application with
  GitHub workflows is to use the official Unikraft GitHub Action available on
  the marketplace.
---

The Unikraft GitHub Actions is designed to programmatically manage repositories
that can be built as a Unikraft unikernel via GitHub Workflows:

- Build projects that have a `Kraftfile`;
- Test unikernels in emulation mode or run the internal test suite;
- Package images into an OCI image and push to compatible registries.

## Basic Usage

In the following example, a repository that has been initialized with a
top-level `Kraftfile` that contains [a
target](/docs/cli/reference/kraftfile#targets) for `qemu/x86_64` will be built
every time a PR is opened, synchronized or re-opened:

```yaml
name: example1

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - uses: unikraft/kraftkit@stable
      with:
        workdir: .
        kraftfile: Kraftfile
        arch: x86_64
        plat: qemu
```

## Using matrices to build multiple targets

If your project [has multiple targets](/docs/cli/reference/kraftfile#targets),
you can use the [workflow `matrix`
syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs)
which enumerates matrices to build each target independently:

```yaml ln={5-12,21-22}
name: example2

jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
        - plat: qemu
          arch: x86_64
        - plat: qemu
          arch: arm64

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - uses: unikraft/kraftkit@stable
      with:
        workdir: .
        kraftfile: Kraftfile
        plat: ${{matrix.plat}}
        arch: ${{matrix.arch}}
```

## Testing run-to-completion-type unikernels

Applications which are designed as run-to-completion, meaning that they execute
a single task non-continuously and exit, can be executed by the GitHub action
via [QEMU's TCG](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/TCG) (which emulates
hardware ISA).  Simply enable the `execute: true` attribute of the action.  This
is useful for applications which perform a single task, or run a suite of tests:

```yaml ln={18}
name: example3

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - uses: unikraft/kraftkit@stable
      with:
        workdir: .
        kraftfile: Kraftfile
        arch: x86_64
        plat: qemu
        execute: true
```

<Info>
See an example with [Unikraft's official
workflow](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/actions/runs/5788361663/job/15687206624#step:5:368)
which runs the internal test suite [`uktest`](/docs/internals/testing).
</Info>

## Inline-`Kraftfile`

For more complex scenarios where you may wish to do variable substitutions in
the workflow file, it is possible to embed the `Kraftfile` directly in the
action, this is possible using the following syntax:

```yaml ln={15-22}
name: example4

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - uses: unikraft/kraftkit@stable
      with:
        workdir: .
        kraftfile: |
          specification: v0.5
          unikraft: stable
          libraries:
            musl: stable
          targets:
          - plat: qemu
            arch: x86_64
        arch: x86_64
        plat: qemu
```

## Packaging and publishing images

The GitHub action, for now, only supports packaging the resulting unikernel
image in [OCI Image
format](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md).  This
allows you to distribute the image using conventional OCI Image Registries, such
as the one provided by [GitHub
(GHCR)](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).
This image format is also recognized by [`kraft`](#).  To publish your image in
a registry, you must first login to the registry and then specify the canonical
name via `output: oci://...` and indicate you wish to `push` the image:

```yaml ln={12-17,25-26}
name: example5

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Login to OCI registry
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        registry: ghcr.io
        username: ${{ secrets.REG_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.REG_TOKEN }}

    - uses: unikraft/kraftkit@stable
      with:
        workdir: .
        kraftfile: Kraftfile
        arch: x86_64
        plat: qemu
        output: oci://ghcr.io/username/repo:latest
        push: true
```
