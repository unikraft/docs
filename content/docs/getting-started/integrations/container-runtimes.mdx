title: Container Runtimes
description: |
  The `runu` OCI runtime enables container managers to run Unikraft unikernels
  inside lightweight virtual machines as if they were Linux containers.
---

You can run Unikraft unikernels packaged by KraftKit through any OCI compliant
container manager using `runu` as a drop-in replacement for the `runc`
container runtime, thus enabling the usage of unikernels with familiar
container tools and platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes.

Examples of OCI compliant container managers include
[containerd](https://containerd.io/) and [cri-o](https://cri-o.io/).

## Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with [packaging Unikraft unikernel binaries as OCI images](/docs/cli/packaging)
- Linux host machine has [virtualization](https://www.linux-kvm.org/) enabled
- Linux host machine has the [QEMU](https://qemu.org/) virtual machine manager installed

## Installation

The `runu` OCI runtime must be installed on the Linux host. It enables
container managers to run Unikraft unikernels as if they were Linux containers.

`runu` is open source and distributed under the umbrella of the
[KraftKit](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit) project on GitHub. It can be
installed in two different manners, which are detailed below.

### Using pre-built binaries

Select the latest release on the [release page for
KraftKit](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/releases), and download the
`kraftkit_runu` tarball for your architecture.

Extract the `runu` binary from this archive, and install it inside one of the
directories listed in the host's `PATH` variable:

```sh
tar -xzvf kraftkit_runu_0.7.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz runu
```

```sh
# PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
sudo install runu /usr/local/bin/
```

### Building from source

Clone the KraftKit project's Git repository onto the Linux host:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit.git
```

Then, build the `runu` binary, and install it inside one of the directories
listed in the host's `PATH` variable:

```sh
make runu
```

```sh
# PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
sudo install runu /usr/local/bin/
```

<Info>
By default, the build is performed inside a Docker container which has the [Go
toolchain](https://go.dev/doc/) and other dependencies pre-installed. To
disable this behaviour and perform the build on the host instead, simply append
the `DOCKER=` parameter to the `make` command above.

## Usage

In this section, we provide examples of running a unikernel that was
pre-packaged as an OCI image by KraftKit.

All examples assume `unikraft.org/app-nginx:latest` as the unikernel image.

### Docker

Running Unikraft unikernels through Docker using the `runu` container runtime
requires enabling the [containerd image
store](https://docs.docker.com/storage/containerd/) inside the Docker Engine.
This feature is currently still considered _experimental_

Then, running a unikernel is as simple as specifying `runu` as the container
runtime on the command line:

```sh
docker run --runtime runu unikraft.org/app-nginx
```

Docker should display the unikernel in a running state, like any other
container:

```console
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID    IMAGE                     COMMAND    STATUS    NAMES
1ecef1190a76    unikraft.org/app-nginx    "--"       Up        boring_wozniak
```

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes requires alternative container runtimes like `runu` to be explicitly
registered, both in Kubernetes and in the underlying container manager.

#### Configuring the container manager

- If the container manager is containerd, add the following section to the
  containerd configuration file (default: `/etc/containerd/config.toml`), and
  restart the `containerd` daemon to apply changes:

   ```toml
   [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.runu]
     runtime_type = "io.containerd.runc.v2"
     [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.runu.options]
       BinaryName = "runu"
   ```

- If the container manager is cri-o, create a new configuration file inside the
  cri-o configuration directory (default: `/etc/crio/crio.conf.d/`), and
  restart the `crio` daemon to apply changes:

   ```toml
   [crio.runtime.runtimes.runu]
   ```

#### Registering a Kubernetes runtime class

Inside Kubernetes, register `runu` as a known runtime using a [Runtime
Class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/) API
object. This can be achieved using the `kubectl create` command with the
following manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: runu
handler: runu
```

#### Running a unikernel Pod

The following Pod definition runs a single-container Pod from our unikernel OCI
image, using `runu` as runtime class. It can be created/started using the
`kubectl command`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-unikernel
spec:
  runtimeClassName: runu
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: unikraft.org/app-nginx
```

Querying the Kubernetes API for running Pods should return the newly created
unikernel Pod:

```console
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME           READY   STATUS    IP           NODE                
my-unikernel   1/1     Running   10.42.0.10   node-1
```
