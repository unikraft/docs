  Unikraft is a fast, secure and open-source Unikernel Development Kit which enables you to easily build minimal, ultra-lightweight virtual machines (unikernels).
---

## Overview

Unikraft allows you to build, at compile time, extremely specialized virtual machines (known as *unikernels*).
Unikraft unikernels provide:

<ul class="list-getting-started">
  <li>High [performance](/docs/concepts/performance) and ultra lightweight deployments.</li>
  <li>Strong, hardware-level [isolation](/docs/concepts/security) (they're VMs!) and a minimal TCB.</li>
  <li>Ease of use, including integration with `Dockerfile`s and other mainstream [tools](/docs/getting-started/integrations/container-runtimes).</li>
  <li>Compatibility with the [Linux API](/docs/concepts/compatibility).</li>
</ul>

The Unikraft ecosystem consists of an extensive build system and tooling, libraries and pre-built unikernel applications.
All of the source code is open-source and licensed under `BSD-3-Clause` (contributions welcome!).
As an active [community](/community/about), we host regular working groups, hackathons, meetups and more.

## Quick Start

To begin first install the [`kraft`](/docs/cli) tool, which allows you to easily leverage Unikraft unikernels at every stage of their lifecycle, from construction to production:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://get.kraftkit.sh | sh
```

See [alternative installation methods](/docs/cli/install) and [CLI usage instructions](/docs/cli).
