## Testing Changes Before Submitting a New PR

### Testing your changes

Make sure that you tested your changes on various setups before opening a new PR.
Try several different configuration options (in particular multiple architectures and platforms) and library combinations.

During development, disable `CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_DEADELIM` (Found in themenuconfig via "Build Options" -> "Drop unused functions and data") so that all of your code is covered by the compiler and linker.

### Using `checkpatch.uk`

To support you in checking your coding style, we provide a tailored version of the Linux kernel's `checkpatch.pl` script in [`support/scripts/checkpatch.uk`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/support/scripts/checkpatch.uk).
You should run this from the `root` of the Unikraft repository because it contains a [`.checkpatch.conf`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/.checkpatch.conf) file which disables some tests that we consider irrelevant for Unikraft.

Please run this script on all commits you are about to submit.
To do this, create a patch file for each commit on your working branch by running `git format-patch`.
For example, to create patch files for the last 5 commits:

```console
$ git format-patch HEAD~5
$ ./support/scripts/checkpatch.uk ./000*
```

You can also run the `checkpatch` on one or multiple files before committing by using the `-f` option.
Furthermore, some errors can be automatically solved by using the `--fix-inplace` option:

```console
$ ./support/scripts/checkpatch.uk --no-tree -f --fix-inplace <path/to/the/file>
```

For example, if you have some changes in the `lib/vfscore/vfs.h`, you can check and fix potential coding style issue with:

```console
$ ./support/scripts/checkpatch.uk --no-tree --fix-inplace -f lib/vfscore/vfs.h
ERROR: "foo*bar" should be "foo *bar"
#576: FILE: lib/vfscore/vfs.h:576:
+intsys_chmod(const char*path, mode_t mode);

total: 1 errors, 0 warnings, 828 lines checked
[...]

$ ./support/scripts/checkpatch.uk --no-tree --fix-inplace -f lib/vfscore/vfs.h
total: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 828 lines checked

lib/vfscore/vfs.h has no obvious style problems and is ready for submission.
```

<Warning>
Note that not all the coding style errors can be solved automatically and some of them should be addressed by hand.
</Warning>

Please attempt fixes for all errors and warnings; if you decide to ignore some, be prepared to have a good reason for each warning and error during the [review process](/docs/contributing/review-process).
