## Unikraft Code Review Process

Pull Requests (PRs) submitted to the Unikraft core or to any official Unikraft micro-library repositories on Github will go through a rigorous code review process before they are accepted and merged.
This is done to ensure the following goals are met:

* **Consistency**:
   Unikraft respects idomatic, consise, clear, and easy to read code.
   This makes understanding code easier for new-commers at any expertise level and also makes debugging easier.
   To achieve this, code in Unikraft is checked with a built-in linter program called [`checkpatch.uk`](/docs/contributing/testing#using-checkpatch).
   This program was derived from the [Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/scripts/checkpatch.pl).
* **Validity**:
   Changes to Unikraft must be valid in that they must solve a specific problem and the way in which it is solved is considered a good or best approach.
* **Efficiency**:
   Unikraft aims to be highly performant, as a result, new code introduced into Unikraft must itself be efficient.
   Often-times this means that even if the new code is working, the reviewer could and should require changes if the same functionality can be achieved in a more efficient way (regarding both time and memory).
* **Safety & security**:
   Unikraft's core code is kernel code and thus acts as a mission critical layer for the runtime of applications which are compiled against it.
   To prevent disruption to the operation of application code and to continue on the security themes which Unikraft addresses, all code is checked rigorously.
* **Integrity**:
   Authorship, a Developer's Certificate of Origin, and auditing are important to attribution and copyright.

This process can take some time but it ensures the stability and integrity of Unikraft.
More often than not, PRs must either be rebased, updated or undergo some change before they are merged.
This is normal and ensures fixes, new features and anything else introduced into Unikraft ecosystem meet the goals listed above.
This is more likely to occur with new features which will often go through multiple rounds or versions with a maintainer or "sheppard".
If you are a first-time contributor, please do not be discouraged by this lengthy process or additional feedback.
This is mentioned now to prevent any suprises regarding the review-process.
Feedback is provided in good spirit, and often-times allows for all parties to be properly informed with the best solution to a given problem.

On this page, we detail how the process of a review of a PR occurs for both those who wish to make new contributions to the core, or any additional micro-library component, as well as those who conduct the reviews themselves.

<Info>
**Reviewers, before you start a review, please:**

* Be polite, considerate, and helpful.
* Comment on positive aspects of PRs as well as changes.
* Be empathetic and mindful of how your review may be received.
* Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions.
* Experienced reviewers, consider pairing with new reviewers whose work requires extensive changes.
</Info>

### Stages of the code review process

1. After [a new PR is submitted](/docs/contributing/unikraft), the first thing to occur are a number of automatic checks and new builds of the branch-to-be-merged from Unikraft's CI/CD system.
   One of the first operations to occur is autolabelling.

1. The operation to occur is the auto-assignment of a reviewer and maintainer (or "sheppard") to the PR.

   * The job of the **reviewer** is to comb through the request for change.
     They will be providing feedback, checking the functionality locally, performing additional spellchecking, and generarlly advising the PR with regard to the goals mentioned above.
   * Theh job of the **maintainer** is to sheppard the PR into a mergable state, [see below](/docs/contributing/review-process#approval-process).

      description="A screenshot from a PR showing the unikraft-bot automatically assigning a reviewer and a maintainer to a PR."
      position="center"
/>

<Info>
   Both the reviewer and the assignee (a.k.a. maintainer) are derived automatically [based on their workload](https://github.com/unikraft/governance/blob/8442d5b8e36179e4df5fe34e25dbba7aa3fedf8d/cmd/sync_pr.go#L540-L556) (i.e. the number of other reviews they have to do) and their affiliation with a Special Interest Group which oversees the area of change the PR affects.
</Info>

1. The next automatic operation to occur is the running of the [`checkpatch.uk`](/docs/contributing/testing#using-checkpatch) program against the PR's branch applied on top of the `staging` the repository in question to ensure each commit meets relevant style, consistency and validity requirements.

<Image
      class="w-auto mx-auto"
      src="/images/unikraft-bot-checkpatch.png"
      title="Automated checkpatch"
      description="An screenshot of a summary from the automatic checkpatch performed on a new PR, this particular checkpatch looks good!"
/>

   If the checkpatch has at all failed, the comment from [unikraft-bot](https://github.com/unikraft-bot) will provide a truncated summary.
   In this case, the PR must be rebased with changes which meet the requirements of the checkpatch.
   For new contributors, please run the `checkpatch.uk` program before creating the PR to streamline the review process.
   A reviewer will typically request for a rebase with the recommendations from the checkpatch before continuing with their review.

1. Along with the `checkpatch.uk`, a number of consistency builds are run in parallel for known architectures and platforms against the [helloworld](https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld) Unikraft application with the branch of the PR.
   These checks will appear at the bottom of the PR, like so:

<Image
      class="w-auto mx-auto"
      src="/images/unikraft-ci-passed.png"
      title="Automated unikernel builds"
      description="Every PR has all the targets of the helloworld application built aganst it ontop of the `staging` branch of the Unikraft core repository."
      position="center"
/>

1. At this point it is up to the reviewer to comb through the requested change to the repository.
   This can be, for example, accomplished by testing the changes locally with [`kraft`](/docs/cli) and by checking out the PR using the [Github CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) in the relevant directory of a fresh clone of related Unikraft repositories at the `staging` branch:

   If the PR is a change to the [Unikraft core repository](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft), then you can simply update the branch of the local clone from the initialization step detailed above:

   ```console
   $ cd /tmp/unikraft-pr-$PR_ID/.unikraft/unikraft
   $ gh pr checkout $PR_ID
   ```

   If the change is to a separate micro-library component, please clone the relevant library or initialize the relevant application.
   Once the PR's code has been applied on top of the `staging` branch of the relevant repository, proceed by configuring the unikernel with appropriate build options, compiling and then running.

1. Detailed comments, general feedback, request for changes or approvals of the PR are done via [Github's PR review manager](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request>).
   Generally you can press the "Files changed" tab of a PR which reveals a diff where you can use to start your review.
   On this page, you can leave in-line comments.

<Warning>
### On receiving feedback and changes

When a PR has had changes requested to it, it is important that the changes are made as part of a rebase and then [force pushing](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12610763) to the original branch.
Simply applying the changes ontop of the previous commits is not sufficient.
If a force push or changes to the branch will re-trigger the review process (see 1, 2 and 3).
</Warning>

### Reviewer checklist

A reviewer of a PR should generally check the following items with regard to the PR in question:

* [ ] Does the PR's checkpatch return all clear?
      Some commits may have a warning instead of an error, can the warning be safely ignored?
* [ ] Do all the tests pass?
* [ ] Is the solution the most efficient and secure?
* [ ] Are there clear comments and [inline documentation](/docs/contributing/coding-conventions/#comments)?
* [ ] Is the code copied or does it include [non-BSD code](/docs/contributing/licensing)?
* [ ] Does this work locally for you?

### Finishing a review

The review may go through a back-and-forth between the authors and the reviewer before the reviewer marks the PR as approved.
As a reviewer, when you consider the process complete you must add an equivilant ["sign off"](/docs/contributing/unikraft#commits) in the same way that the author has.
This is done by adding a "Reviewed-by" Git trailer like so:

```text
Reviewed-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```

To do this, you can navigate to the "Files changed" tab of a PR which reveals a diff and access the review box.
Then simply select one of the available requests and add along with your comments the trailer.

Adding a `Reviewed-by` tag is important to the CI/CD system, as it signals that a review has been completed which is the first lock of the merge process.

## Approval process

The approval process of a PR is the final step before a PR is merged and is performed by a maintainer or sheppard.
Maintainers are also auto assigned by [unikraft-bot](https://github.com/unikraft-bot) and will check both the PR and the review to ensure consistency with the goals mentioned above as well as this very review process.

### Approving a PR

Much like providing a review to a PR, an approval must be made when the PR is absolutely ready to be merged.
An approval will unlock the CI/CD system and will automatically merge the PR into the desired repository.

An approval must use Github's review tool and mark the PR as state "approved" this can be done in the same way as the review in the figure above, or alternatively it can be done with GitHub's CLI companion tool like so:

```console
$ gh pr review https://github.com/unikraft/app-nginx/pull/2 \
    --approve \
    --body "Approved-by: Your Name <your@email.com>"
```

The only difference is the trailer, which should be `Approved-by`.
