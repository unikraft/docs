## Documentation

As with the other parts of Unikraft, we welcome contributions to the [documentation repository](https://github.com/unikraft/docs).
Documentation is written using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), since it make it easy to use `JSX` components.

We follow the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for contributions.
Submit new content, corrections and improvements to documentation as pull requests (PRs) that we will then review and approve in the documentation.
You can add entire sections if you think a topic is missing or update existing ones with missing information.

You can also open up [an issue](https://github.com/unikraft/docs/issues) to signal a problem or a missing part in the documentation that you request someone to fix.

We use English as the documentation language.
Please proofread your text before submitting a pull request.

Write each sentence on a new line, since it make the content easy to review and modify.
This way, changing one sentence only affects one line in the source code, and it is easier to follow the content and the reviewes.

Prefer using the 1st person plural for consistency across the entire repository.
Use phrases like "we run the command / app", "we look at the source code", "we provide support".

### Content Layout

The content has the following structure:

```text
content
|-- blog/                   # Blog posts, <date>-<blogpost title>.md
|-- community/              # Community related content (events, general information, etc.)
|-- docs/                   # Unikraft documentation, split by categories into subdirectories
|-- guides/                 # Short and on point guides, good for getting started
|-- hackathons/             # Hackathon landing pages
|-- imprint.md
|-- privacy.md
`-- releases/               # Unikraft releases summaries
```

### Testing Changes

Before you submit your changes for review, please make sure you have tested them thoroughly.
You can build and deploy the site locally, following [the instructions below](/docs/contributing/docs/#building-the-website).
You can also validate your changes for common issues using the [`super-linter`](https://github.com/github/super-linter), following the [instructions below](#using-the-linter).
Please also do a spell check on your changes.
Most text editors should be able to do that by themselves, [here's how you do it in `Vim`](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/vim-spell-checking).

#### Building the Website

You can build the website inside a Docker environment or natively.
Building inside a Docker environment is **strongly recommended**, since you will work in the same environment as the deployed website.

#### Building the Website Inside a Docker Environment

You can build the site inside a Docker environment.
For this, you will need to install Docker-CE.
You can do that by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/docker/docker-install), or by running:

```console
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```
### Important Note
If you happen to be using `MacOS`, please refer to the following documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/) instead.

<Info>
Building the site inside a Docker environment is highly recommended, since you will work in the same environment as the deployed site, so there will be no errors regarding packages version or filesystem layout.
</Info>

To deploy the site, run (in the directory of the repository clone):

```console
docker build -t ghcr.io/unikraft/docs:base --target base .

docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/docs -w /docs -p 3000:3000 --entrypoint sh ghcr.io/unikraft/docs:base

# The commands below should be used in the docker container

yarn install
yarn run dev
```

You may need admin privileges to run the first 2 commands.
Open up your browser and point to http://localhost:3000 to check the deployed documentation website.

#### Building the Website Natively

You can also build the site natively.
For a native build, you need to install `node`.
You can do it by following the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

<Info>
This may lead to errors due to different `node` versions or other environment problems.
These problems can be avoided by building the website inside a Docker environment.
</Info>

Then, to build and deploy the site, run:

```console
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

As above, open up your browser and point to http://localhost:3000 to check the deployed documentation website.

#### Using the Linter

To automate a big part of the reviewing process, we use the [`super-linter`](https://github.com/github/super-linter) on the `docs` repository.
It runs as a GitHub action on every time you do a push, checking all the changed files.

<Image
      src="/assets/imgs/github-super-linter.png"
      class="w-auto mx-auto"
      title="Checking the superliner output"
      description="If you open a pull request, you will see the linter output under the checks section."
      position="center"
/>

If you click on `Details`, you can see the full linter output.
The most relevant part is under the `Lint Code Base` section, where you can find the full error messages and the line that generated the error.

<Image
      src="/assets/imgs/github-super-linter-output.png"
      class="w-auto mx-auto"
      title="Checking the superlinter output"
      description="Full linter output. Error was caused by line 79 in file `content/en/blog/2022-12-03-random-device-support-in-unikraft.md`"
      position="center"
/>

Since the linter checks the entire file, you may find yourself with a lot of errors from lines that you did not modify.
Please make sure that the errors are not caused by the lines that you added or modified.
If you have the time to add a commit to your pull request, that fixes all the linting errors within the modified files, we will be forever grateful :pray:

#### Running the Linter Locally

You can also run the linter locally, before creating the pull request.
[`super-linter`](https://github.com/github/super-linter) is actually a collection of linters;
for a local run, you need to install and then run the required linters.

For the Unikraft documentation repository, used and useful linters are:

- [`markdown-cli`](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli#readme)
- [`textlint`](https://textlint.github.io/)
- [`jscpd`](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd)

To run the `super-linter` locally, follow the instructions from [here](https://github.com/github/super-linter/blob/main/docs/run-linter-locally.md).
Note that this will require quite a lot of storage, since it will pull the `super-linter` Docker image.

You will need to install Docker, following the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
After that, pull the latest container by running:

```console
docker pull github/super-linter:latest
```

To run the `super-linter` on a given directory, use a command similar to:

```console
docker run -e RUN_LOCAL=true -e USE_FIND_ALGORITHM=true -v /path/to/directory/to/check:/tmp/lint github/super-linter
```

This will start a docker container that will run the `super-linter` checks on the given directory:

```

A sample run, while in the root directory of this documentation repository, is:

```console
docker run -e RUN_LOCAL=true -e USE_FIND_ALGORITHM=true -v $(pwd)/content/docs/contributing/:/tmp/lint/ github/super-linter
```

You can also run each linter separately, since it will require less storage space.
To run the linters, you will need to install the [`markdown-cli`](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli), [`textlint`](https://textlint.github.io/docs/getting-started.html) and [`jscpd`](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd#installation) tools:

```console
npm install markdownlint-cli
npm install textlint
npm install jscpd
```

Note that it's likely that these linters require a more recent version of `node` than the default package installation.
Install the most recent one using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
First, install `nvm` using [the instructions here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
Then install the most recent version of `node` and follow the instructions:

```console
nvm install node
# Follow instructions shown by the above command.
nvm use node
node --version # Check node version.
```

The `textlinter` will require installation of rules.
You can find a list of rules [here](https://github.com/textlint/textlint/wiki/Collection-of-textlint-rule).

```console
npm install textlint-rule-terminology
npm install textlint-rule-no-todo
```

Use the linters with `npx` from the documentation directory:

```console
npx markdownlint --config .github/workflows/config/config.json --rules .github/workflows/rules/rules.js path/to/markdown/file.mdx
npx textlint --config .github/workflows/.textlintrc --rule <rule-name> path/to/markdown/file.mdx
npx jscpd <path> # Typically a directory
```

For example:

```console
 npx markdownlint --config .github/workflows/config/config.json --rules .github/workflows/rules/rules.js content/docs/contributing/*.mdx
```

```text
_index.md:14:187 MD033/no-inline-html Inline HTML [Element: a]

#### Running the URL checker

When new additional material is added, it's a good practice to run a URL [checker](https://github.com/topics/link-checker) on the new pages that have been added.

You can use any tool you find easy to setup or use, Below are two examples:

Using [linkchecker](https://github.com/linkchecker/linkchecker):

```bash
$ pip install linkchecker
$ linkchecker http://localhost:3000/docs/new-entry -r 1 # -r 1 limits the check to just the url given
...
URL        `docs/broken-url'
Name       `baby-steps'
Parent URL http://localhost:3000/docs/contributing/docs, line 127, col 28
Real URL   http://localhost:3000/docs/contributing/docs/broken-url
Check time 4.030 seconds
Result     Error: 404 Not Found
```

Using [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee):

```bash
$ lychee content/docs/path/to/new-entry               # lychee can run checks on our files directly
$ lychee http://localhost:3000/docs/new-entry         # and can be run against our local development website
$ lychee --offline content/docs/contributing/docs.mdx # --ofline limits the checks to just our local files instead
  27/27 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Finished extracting links                                                                                            Issues found in 1 input. Find details below.

[content/docs/contributing/docs.mdx]:
✗ [ERR] file:///.../unikraft/docs/content/docs/contributing/docs/broken-url | Failed: Cannot find file

🔍 27 Total (in 1s) ✅ 26 OK 🚫 1 Error
```

Pre-built binaries can be found on the [release](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/releases/latest) page.

For example, to install and extract the binary built for Linux:

```bash
$ pushd /tmp
$ curl -OL https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/releases/download/v0.14.3/<release>.tar.gz
$ tar -xf <release>.tar.gz # this would create a `lychee` binary in our current directory
$ mv ./lychee ~/.local/bin # we place the binary in our local home dir path
$ popd
```

The above assumes we have already configured our default shell to include `~/.local/bin` in the `PATH` by already having `export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin` defined in our `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, depending on the default shell set.

We can also place the binary in our working project directory and call it from there `./lychee` or anywhere on the filesystem, assuming we provide the full path to it.

**Limitations:**

Url checkers will not catch all broken references, for example, an empty url block `[foobar](#)` or a section that does not exist within our file `[foobar](#foo-section)` (better detected with the markdown [linter](#running-the-linter-locally)), but they can help eliminate some cases like typos or moved content.

### Reviewing Changes

If you are assigned as a reviewer to a pull request (PR), please follow the [testing steps](#testing-changes) and make sure everything looks good.

The review may go through a set of back-and-forth steps between the author and the reviewer before the reviewer marks the PR as approved.
As a reviewer, when you consider the process complete, you must add a signature, in the same way that the author has.
This is done by writing adding a `Reviewed-by` line as part of your approval message in the GitHub review interface:

```text
Reviewed-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```
