title: Coding Conventions
description: |
  Coding conventions are important to maintain consistency and readability in
  software development, making code easier to understand, debug, review and
  maintain by multiple developers over time.  Learn how the Unikraft core
  codebase is organized and how its code is written.
---

These are conventions for writing code and naming and placing things inside the [Unikraft core codebase](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft).
Maintainers would be the ones who judge if there are certain corner cases when a rule doesn't need to be applied.

Some example of extreme cases:

* Having line with more than 80 characters, as they are easily searchable.
  You can see an example [here](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/plat/drivers/virtio/virtio_pci.c#L141C1-L141C87).
* Using `typedef struct` to enhance readability, as you can see [here](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/plat/kvm/include/kvm-x86/multiboot.h#L96).

## Basics

The layout uses the following basic rules.
You may install [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) as there is a `.editorconfig` file in the top-level directory to automatically enforce these.

* Unikraft uses **tabs + spaces** for indentation, with tabs being 8 characters wide.
  Tabs first, further indentation less than 8 characters are done with spaces (Linux style).
* Source files are **80 columns** wide.
  * There are some scenarios where this limit could be passed, due to [readability reasons](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/bdc48fa11e46f867ea4d75fa59ee87a7f48be144).
* No trailing whitespaces.
* Insert a final newline.

Always run [support/scripts/checkpatch.uk](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/support/scripts/checkpatch.uk) to make sure your source file complies with the latest Unikraft coding conventions.

### License Header

Each file should have an SPDX identifier and license comment.
There is an empty newline after the license.
Unikraft uses the [BSD-3-Clause](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/COPYING.md).

```clike
/* SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause */
/* Copyright (c) 2023, Unikraft GmbH and The Unikraft Authors.
 * Licensed under the BSD-3-Clause License (the "License").
 * You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
 */

#include <somefile.h>
```

### Using Foreign Code

When using foreign code, always make sure that the code uses a **compatible (permissive) license**.
We have a **strong preference** for BSD-3-Clause.
Other compatible licenses are, for example: Public domain, [BSD-2-Clause](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-2-clause/), [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/), [Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/).
Incompatible licenses are, for example: [GPL](https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0/), [LGPL](https://opensource.org/license/lgpl-3-0/).

<Warning>
This in particular means that basing your work on Linux kernel source code is **not permitted**.
</Warning>

### Minor Foreign Contributions

If you based only parts of your implementation on some other author's work (e.g., importing a function, using an algorithm etc.) you can add a separate block after the license header or before the particular piece of code:

```clike
/* You may not use this file except in compliance with the License. */

/* Parts of the implementation are based on
 * PROJECT (VERSION) by AUTHOR <EMAIL>
 * Git repository, commit ID
 * LICENSE IF NEEDED
 */

#include <somefile.h>
```

The version information is the software version number.
If a Git repository is available, provide a link to the repository and the commit hash used.
If the foreign license is the same as the source fileâ€™s license you do not need to provide the additional license copy.

### Major Foreign Contributions

If you import a foreign source file, keep the existing author and license information.
Note that when you make changes to the file, some licenses (e.g., `Apache 2.0`) require that you explicitly state that you changed the file.

### Adding Additional Authors

If your changes are small (e.g., a bugfix or a small extension) and it is not required by the license, consider not adding your name to the list of authors (and the corresponding copyright) if present.
This improves the visibility of the information about who the original authors are.
Your changes will be tracked by the Git history anyway and show up using `git blame`.

## Coding Style

For improved readability and maintainability your code should adhere to the rules laid out in this chapter.
The conventions are similar to the Linux kernel coding style to make developing code for Unikraft a familiar experience for people who have already worked with the Linux kernel code.
Thus, some of the examples have been taken from the Linux kernel coding style guide.

### Braces

Opening braces are placed at the end of the line that opens the new scope. Closing braces are put on a separate line:

```clike variant=good
if (condition) {
        /* ... */
}
```

```clike variant=good
struct my_struct {
        /* ... */
};
```

However, there are some exceptions.
Opening braces for functions are placed on a new line:

```clike variant=good
void func(void)
{
        /* ... */
}
```

Separate lines for the closing braces are also not used in the following cases to reduce the number of empty lines:

```clike variant=good
if (condition) {
        /* ... */
} else if (condition) {
        /* ... */
} else {
        /* ... */
}
```

```clike variant=good
do {
        /* ... */
} while (condition);
```

**Do not use braces** for single line statements:

```clike variant=good
if (condition)
        single_statement();
else
        single_statement();
```

```clike variant=good
while (condition)
        single_statement();
```

But use braces for the `else block` if the `if block` requires them:

```clike variant=good
if (condition) {
        single_statement();
        single_statement();
} else {
        single_statement();
}
```

### Spaces

Generally, put a space after keywords like `if`, `switch`, `case`, `for`, `do`, `while`, `return`.

```clike variant=good
if (condition)
```

```clike variant=bad
if(condition)
```

Also put a space after a comma:

```clike variant=good
void func(int arg0, int arg2)
```

```clike variant=bad
void func(int arg0,int arg2)
void func(int arg0 ,int arg2)
```

And around most operators (except unary operators):

```clike variant=good
a = b + c;
```

```clike variant=good
if (a == b)
```

```clike variant=good
a = (condition) ? 1 : 2;
```

For unary operators and structure member operators **do not use** a space:

```clike variant=good
p = &var;
```

```clike variant=good
if (!condition)
```

```clike variant=good
a = ~c & b;
```

```clike variant=good
a->field = 0xdeadb0b0;
```

Do not put spaces around keywords like `sizeof`, `typeof`, `alignof`,`__attribute__` and around `(inside)` parenthesized expressions:

```clike variant=good
s = sizeof(p);
```

```clike variant=bad
s = sizeof ( p );
```

```clike variant=bad
if ( condition )
```

Always put the asterisk (`*`) for pointer definitions adjacent to the data or function name.
This is to avoid the misconception that `char* a, b` defines two pointers, whereas, in fact, only `a` is a pointer.

```clike variant=good
char *myfunc(void *p)
{
        char *a, *b, c;
        /* ... */

        return (char *) p;
}
```

### Comments

* Always use multi-line comments escaping even for single line comments:

  ```clike variant=good
  /* Single line comment */
  if (condition)
  ```

  ```clike variant=good
  int var;  /* comment */
  ```

  ```clike variant=bad
  int var;  // comment
  ```

* Use a separate line to close the comment for actual multi-line comments.
  There is a leading space to align the lines:

  ```clike variant=good
  /* This is a multi line comment because it is so incredibly
   * useful that the contents does not fit into one line
   */
  ```

* Ending the comment with a period is not necessary.
  Just keep it consistent.

* Use spaces instead of tabs to indent within comments.

* Start comments with capital letters in case of sentences.

### Function Documentation

Functions that are exported by a library or define an otherwise publicly visible interface need to be properly documented in the header file.
Use [Doxygen-style](https://www.doxygen.nl/) comments for this.
Note the double-asterisk (\*\*) at the beginning:

```clike variant=good
/**
 * Tries to allocate the requested number of bytes from the default memory
 * allocator. The actual amount of allocated memory can be smaller.
 *
 * @param size
 *   Number of bytes to allocate
 * @param[out] p
 *   Pointer to the newly allocated memory on success, NULL otherwise
 *
 * @return
 *   The number of bytes actually allocated
 */
size_t try_alloc(size_t size, void **p);
```

* Use dots when ending a sentence or when a new sentence starts afterward.

* Start the description on a new line for Doxygen variables (`@param`, `@return`).

* For referencing Doxygen variables, you can use the [official documentation](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/autolink.html).

* The return can be omitted for trivial getter functions:

  ```clike variant=good
  /**
   * Returns the size of the given buffer
   */
  size_t get_size(void *p);
  ```

  For return values, use the convention:

  * `\- (0)`:  Successfully initialized
  * `\- (<0)`: Negative value with error code

  Basically, list return values as list items.

### Struct Member Documentation

* Use double asterisk for multi-line comments (`/**`).

* When having flags, point to definition of macros in the same or another file.

* Check how Doxygen renders macro comments and then decide on the best approach to format.

### Definitions

#### Variable Definitions

Variables are defined at the beginning of the block.
The block is separated from the code with a blank line.

```clike variant=good
int my_func(void)
{
        int *ptr;
        int i, num;

        ptr = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
        if (unlikely(!ptr))
                return -ENOMEM;

        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
                num = /* ... */;
}
```

```clike variant=bad
int my_func(void)
{
        void *ptr = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));

        if (unlikely(!ptr))
                return -ENOMEM;

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
                int num = /* ... */;
}
```

#### Naming

Identifiers in Unikraft use `snake case`:

```clike variant=good
void my_func(void); /* Snake Case  */
```

```clike variant=bad
void myFunc(void);  /* Camel Case  */
```

```clike variant=bad
void MyFunc(void);  /* Pascal Case */
```

An exception to this are constants and preprocessor macros, which should use all uppercase and words separated by underscores:

```clike variant=good
const int MAGIC_VALUE = 0xdeadb0b0;
```

```clike variant=good
#define IS_DEAD(bobo) ((bobo) == MAGIC_VALUE)
```

Macro names may also be regular function names if they are just wrappers for actual functions (see `uk_vprintk()` below) or if the functionality might be either implemented as macro or function (e.g., depending on architecture).

### Leading Underscores

A leading single underscore is **discouraged** but may be used selectively to mark identifiers which should not be used directly, like in the header `<uk/print.h>`:

```clike variant=good
#if CONFIG_LIBUKDEBUG_PRINTK
/* please use the uk_printk(), uk_vprintk() macros because they compile in the
 * function calls only if the configured debug level requires it
 */
void _uk_vprintk(int lvl, const char *libname, const char *srcname,
                 unsigned int srcline, const char *fmt, va_list ap);


#define uk_vprintk(lvl, fmt, ap) \
        do { \
                if ((lvl) <= KLVL_MAX)  \
                        _uk_vprintk((lvl), __STR_LIBNAME__, __STR_BASENAME__, \
                        __LINE__, (fmt), ap); \
        } while (0)
```

Prefer using `UK_PAGE_SIZE` instead of `_PAGE_SIZE` if required to avoid a symbol clash.

However, leading underscores should **not** be used to name private symbols within the same source file.
You should use the `static` keyword for private symbols.

```clike variant=bad
static void _i_am_private(int arg)
{
        /* ... */
}

void i_am_public(int arg)
{
        _i_am_private(arg);
}
```

Leading double underscores may only be used for:

* low-level native Unikraft types like `__u64` and `__spinlock`.

* header include guards.

* preprocessor macros to add another level of indirection for macro resolution.

The reason for that may be potential clashes with libc/compiler symbols.
So, for example, instead of `__NULL` use `UK_NULL`.
And instead of `__nonnull` use `uk_nonnull`.

<Info>
Rule of thumb: include `libc` headers first and then Unikraft headers.
This is similar to [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/process/coding-style.html#typedefs).

Furthermore, include files should be added to files in alphabetical order **if possible**.
</Info>

### Prefixes

Unikraft uses name prefixes to express that an identifier is part of a certain API, component or namespace.

```text
<UK API>_<COMPONENT>_<NAME>
```

Unikraft reserves the following API prefixes to describe **functions**, **function-like macros** and **data types** of the Unikraft API. This also applies (CAPITALIZED) for macros:

* `uk_` - denotes a public Unikraft API at the library level.
The implementation is usually found in one of the libraries in `/lib` or defined in the headers in `/include/uk`.
For example: `uk_alloc()`.

* `ukplat_` - denotes a public Unikraft API, whose implementation is usually provided in `/plat` and depends on the platform (e.g., KVM) for which the unikernel is compiled.
For example: `ukplat_page_map()`.

* `ukarch_` - denotes a public Unikraft API, whose implementation is usually provided in `/arch` and depends on the architecture (e.g., x86-64) for which the unikernel is compiled.
For example: `ukarch_tlb_flush()`.

Use a verb at the end of the function name (`_init`, `_clean`, `_add,` `_clone`).

The component prefix makes it easy to identify related symbols.
For example, functions related to thread management use the thread prefix and functions related to page mapping use the page prefix:

```clike
void uk_thread_block(struct uk_thread *thread);
```

```clike
int ukplat_page_map(...);
```

The component prefix should also be used for private functions, but without the public API prefix (cc = coding conventions):

```clike
static int cc_myfunc(int arg)
{
        /* ... */
}

int uk_cc_myfunc(int arg)
{
       return cc_myfunc(arg);
}
```

If the library defines functions that are private, but architecture specific, they should follow the pattern used for the public Unikraft API (here ccarch_):

```clike
static int cc_myfunc(int arg)
{
        if (arg == 42)
                ccarch_do_something();
}
```

<Info>
* Public is defined in `exportsyms.uk`.

* Private is not as part of `exportsyms.uk` or part of `localsyms.uk`.

* If there is no `exportsyms.uk` defined, then all functions are exported.
</Info>

### Typedefs

*Rule of thumb*: **Do not** use typedefs.

**Do not** use the `_t` suffix when defining types.
It seems that `_t` types are POSIX-reserved.
Consider using `_func` suffix if you require defining function pointer data types (those situations should be rare - such as passing a function pointer to another function or **using it in multiple places**).

```clike variant=good
typedef int (*cmp_func)(int, int);
void sort(int *array1, cmp_func *f)
```

### Usage of Unikraft Types

Unikraft defines aliases for most of the basic data types (e.g., `__u8`, `__sz`).
Use them where possible, when the component can live without `libc dependency` (`nolibc`, `musl`, `newlib`); use them instead of libc data types such as `uint32_t`.
For sure, architecture, platform code, drivers.

#### sizeof

Prefer to take the size of a variable instead of the variable's type so that the size remains valid if the variable's type changes:

```clike variant=good
struct my_struct p;
s = sizeof(p);

struct my_struct *p;
s = sizeof(*p);
```

```clike variant=bad
struct my_struct p;
s = sizeof(struct my_struct);
```

### Return Values

For functions that should return error values, use negative error codes from `errno.h` if possible.
These are well known and provide adequate values in most cases.
Avoid defining custom error codes.
Use 0 for success.
This is to be used both for Unikraft APIs and for lower-level components.

<Info title="Rationale">
`errno` values have good coverage in the types of errors.
It is easier to use a "standard" set of values (`errno`) to signal errors, even in lower-level components.
</Info>

```clike
#include <errno.h>

int do_something(void arg)
{
        if (arg > 42)
                return -EINVAL; /* failure */

        return 0; /* success */
}
```

Include `errno.h` in the source code files, not in the API header files.
Platform API shouldnâ€™t provide `errno.h`.

Boolean-type functions should use `__bool` as return type and indicate:

* true (success) with a non-zero value.

* false (failure) with 0.

<Info>
Do not assume that true is 1; true may be a non-zero value.
When using the return value of a boolean function, use `if (result)` or `if (!result)` to cover the case for true being a non-zero value.
</Info>

```clike
__bool is_bobo(int bobo)
{
        if (bobo == 0xb0b0)
                return 1; /* true, it is b0b0 */


        return 0; /* false */
}
```

#### Switch Statements

The cases in switch statements are **not indented**.

```clike
switch (var) {
case 0:
        /* ... */
        break;
case 1:
        /* ... */
        break;
default:
        /* ... */
        break;
}
```

### Goto Statements

`goto` labels should **NOT** be indented.
The name of the label should be: `err_...` or `out_...`, depending on the context.

Generally, `goto` should be avoided for simple "retry"-style constructs.
Use a while-loop instead.

Gotos can be a good solution to implement a common error/finalization path.
This reduces the probability that some error paths may leak resources or do not release all locks (in the correct order).
This can easily happen as error paths are usually less well tested.
If, however, possible, return directly.

```clike variant=good
int cc_myfunc(void)
{
        void *a, *b;
        int rc = 0;

        a = malloc(...);
        if (unlikely(!a)) {
                rc = -ENOMEM;
                goto err_out;
        }

        b = malloc(...);
        if (unlikely(!b)) {
                rc = -ENOMEM;
                goto err_free_a;
        }

        /* ... */
        free(b);

err_free_a:
        free(a);
err_out:
        return rc;
}
```

```clike variant=bad
int cc_myfunc(void)
{
        void *a, *b;

        a = malloc(...);
        if (unlikely(!a))
                return -ENOMEM;


        b = malloc(...);
        if (unlikely(!b)) {
                free(a);
                return -ENOMEM;
        }

        /* ... */
        free(b);
        free(a);
        return 0;
}
```

### Assembly

#### Code

Indentation for ASM code:

* Multi line (Tab at the beginning, Tab between instructions and operands, `\n` at the end)
* Removing the Tab could also be considered.
  But this would lead to having `\n\t` at the end.
  Which might not be ideal if the code is later modified and requires the addition of a label.

#### Inline Assembly

```clike
asm volatile (
    "1:      instr      op, op\n"
    "        instr2     op, op\n"
    :::);
```

* Single-line

* Prefer using `asm volatile` over `__asm__ __volatile__`.

* Aim to add a comment for each inline assembly line, detailing what it does.

* Ignore for repetitive operations (such as `mov`-s).

  * Ignore long lines for inline assembly, when including comments.

  * Aim to have short comments.
    We could also have multi-line comments.

### Breaking Long Lines

1. Break before function name (after function return type).
1. Align function arguments after break to open parenthesis.

For functions, align arguments on different line:

```clike
UK_SYSCALL_R_DEFINE(int, getpeername, int, sock,
                    struct sockaddr *restrict, addr,
                    socklen_t *restrict, addr_len)
```

For conditions, always align to the parenthesis.

```clike
if (a == 0 && \
    (b == 10 || \
     c == 12) || \
    d == 15)
```

Function name and first argument are atomic.

Prefer the Linux style with the return type on the same line as the function name.
In case of long functions + first argument, you can break after the return type.

### Preprocessor Macros

This is referenced in [the definitions](docs/contributing/coding-conventions#definitions) section for prefixes (i.e. the use of `uk_`, `ukplat_`, `ukarch_` prefixes).
Recommendation for using macros as (inline) functions:

* Follow the same conventions as functions.

* This brings flexibility in switching between one or the other.

* Some macros as functions would still be uppercase (such as `UK_MIN`, `UK_MAX`).

* Place each argument (that is a variable) between parentheses.

* If using a variable multiple times, itâ€™s better to use a temporary variable declaration in the macro that stores the variable.

### UK_ASSERT

1. Have `UK_ASSERT` even in the absence of `ukdebug`.
1. `UK_CRASH` is for situations where you can not formalize an assertion.
   Something like `UK_ASSERT(false)`.
1. `UK_BUG_ON` should never be removed from the code (with condition).
   The same applies for `UK_CRASH` (without condition).
1. Change behavior of `UK_BUG_ON` to always be part of the code, even in release builds.

### Parameter Validation

Do rigorous parameter validation.
However, parameter validation should be done using assertions where the parameter can be expected to be not directly determined by external input.
This means in particular that `uk_`, `ukplat_`, and `ukarch_` APIs should use `UK_ASSERT()`:

```clike variant=good
int uk_cc_myfunc(int bobo)
{
        UK_ASSERT(bobo == 0xdead);

        /* do something */
}
```

```clike variant=bad
int uk_cc_myfunc(int bobo)
{
        if (unlikely(bobo == 0xdead))
                return -EINVAL;

        /* do something */
}
```

This is in contrast to, for example, POSIX, where explicit parameter validation is expected.
In a unikernel, though, we see the OS components as an (internal) extension to the application.
Users of the APIs are thus expected to make sure only sane parameters are used just like with internal application functions.

Generally, use the `unlikely()` macro when checking for error cases (only).
It is defined in `<uk/essentials.h>`.

When working with the low-level Unikraft API, it is essential to validate parameters using `UK_ASSERT` when specific parameter ranges need to be enforced.
In cases where there is no explicit specification, performing an error check is recommended to ensure parameter validity.

When working with higher-level APIs, parameter validation should be handled by returning appropriate error codes according to the relevant standard (such as POSIX).

### Comment Keywords

1. `NOTE`: Description of how the code works (when it isn't self-evident).
1. `XXX:` Warning about possible pitfalls, can be used as `NOTE:XXX:`.
1. `HACK`: Not very well written or malformed code to circumvent a problem/bug.
   Should be used as `HACK:FIXME`.
1. `FIXME`: This works, sort of, but it could be done better (usually code written in a hurry that needs rewriting).
1. `BUG`: There is a problem here.
1. `TODO`: No problem, but additional code needs to be written, usually when you are skipping something.
1. `UNDONE`: A reversal or "roll back" of previous code
1. `OPTIMIZE`: Code can / should be optimized.

### Magic Numbers

Any magic number using hexspeak and that is introduced with new code should not be discriminatory or sexual in any way.
Rumor has it that our Unikraft mascot is named Bobo.
So, newly introduced magic numbers have manifested around Bobo (`0xB0B0`).
This list of magic numbers sorted by categories can help in choosing one:

| Magic number        | Source            |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| `DEADB0B0`          | Dead Bobo         |
| `B0B0DEAD`          | Bobo dead         |
| `BADB0B0`           | Bad Bobo          |
| `B0B0F00D`          | Bobo food (obviously a banana) |
| `B0B0CAFE`          | Bobo coffee       |
| `B0B0C0DE`          | Bobo code (was it coded by Bobo?) |
| `B007B0B0`          | Boot Bobo (Unikraft bootinfo magic) |
| `B0B0B055`          | Bobo boss         |

Only use capital hex digits (`B` instead of `b`).

<Info>
When used in source code, the symbol of the magic number should be used, never the value.
For example:

```clike
#define UKPLAT_BOOTINFO_MAGIC  0xB007B0B0 /* Boot Bobo */
#define UKTLS_SANITY_MAGIC     0xB0B0F00D /* Bobo food */ 
```
