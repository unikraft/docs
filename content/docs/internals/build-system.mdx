## Internals of the Unikraft Build System

As we saw in the [Build Process section](/internals/build-process), Unikraft uses a set of files as part of the configuration and build steps.
When porting an application, you want to be aware of these files and tune them to your needs.
This section delves into the internals of the Unikraft build system and how they are useful for porting an application.

In order for an application or library to work with the [Unikraft `Make`-based build system](/internal/build-process), you need to provide some specific files:

1. **Makefile**:
   Used to specify where the main Unikraft repository is with respect to the application's repository, as well as repositories for any external libraries the application needs to use.
   The `Makefile` is not required when porting an external library.

1. **Makefile.uk**:
   Used to specify which sources to build (and optionally where to fetch them from), include paths, flags and any application-specific targets.

1. **Config.uk**:
   A [Kconfig-like](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/kbuild/kconfig-language.html) snippet used to populate Unikraft's menu with application-specific options.

1. **exportsyms.uk**:
   A text file where each line contains the name of one symbol that should be exported to other libraries.
   This file usually contains only the `main()` function for an application that is developed/ported as a single library to Unikraft.

<Info>
   If an `exportsyms.uk` file is not present, all symbols will be exported.
</Info>

1. **extra.ld**:
   **Optional,** contains an amendment to the main linker script.

In the tutorial below, we will focus on files belonging to an application (i.e. not to a library).
The process of porting a library is very similar, just change the `APP` prefix of the variable names to `LIB`.

### Makefile

The `Makefile` is generally short and simple and might remind you of Linux kernel modules that are built off-tree.
For most applications the `Makefile` should contain no more than the following:

```Makefile
UK_ROOT  ?= $(PWD)/workdir/unikraft
UK_LIBS  ?= $(PWD)/workdir/libs
UK_PLATS ?= $(PWD)/workdir/plats
LIBS  := $(UK_LIBS)/lib1:$(UK_LIBS)/lib2:$(UK_LIBS)/libN
PLATS ?=

all:
        @make -C $(UK_ROOT) A=$(PWD) L=$(LIBS) P=$(PLATS)

$(MAKECMDGOALS):
        @make -C $(UK_ROOT) A=$(PWD) L=$(LIBS) P=$(PLATS) $(MAKECMDGOALS)
```

You can notice that the `Makefile` is just a wrapper around the [Unikraft core `Makefile`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/Makefile).
You can get the same result if you use:

```console
$ make -C workdir/unikraft A=. L=workdir/libs/lib1:workdir/libs/lib2:workdir/libs/libN
```

### Makefile.uk

The Unikraft build system provides a number of functions and macros to make it easier to write the `Makefile.uk` file.
Also, ensure that all variables that you define begin with `APP[NAME]_` or `LIB[NAME]_` (e.g., `APPHELLOWORLD_`) so that they are properly namespaced.

The first thing to do is to call [the Unikraft `addlib` function](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/support/build/Makefile.rules#L195) to register the application with the system (note the letters `lib`: everything in Unikraft is ultimately a library).
This function call will also populate `APPNAME_BASE` (containing the directory path to the application sources) and `APPNAME_BUILD` (containing the directory path to the application's build directory):

```Makefile
$(eval $(call addlib,appname))
```

where `name` would be replaced by your application's name.
In case your main application code should be downloaded as an archive from a remote server, the next step is to set up a variable to point to a URL with the application sources (or objects, or pre-linked libraries, see further below), and to call [the Unikraft `fetch` function](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/support/build/Makefile.rules#L456) to download and unpack those sources (`APPNAME_ORIGIN` is populated containing the directory path to the extracted files):

```Makefile
APPNAME_ZIPNAME = myapp-v0.0.1
APPNAME_URL = http://app.org/$(APPNAME_ZIPNAME).zip
$(eval $(call fetch,appname,$(APPNAME_URL)))
```

Next we set up a call to [the Unikraft `patch` function](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/support/build/Makefile.rules#L360).
Even if you don't have any patches yet, it's good to have this set up in case you need it later.

```Makefile
APPNAME_PATCHDIR=$(APPNAME_BASE)/patches
$(eval $(call patch,appname,$(APPNAME_PATCHDIR),$(APPNAME_ZIPNAME)))
```

With all of this in place, you can already start testing things out:

```console
$ make menuconfig
[choose appropriate options and save configuration, see user's guide]
$ make
```

You should see Unikraft downloading the application archive and unpacking it.
It will do the same for libraries specified in the `Makefile` or through the menu.
Libraries will then be built.
There will be nothing to build for your application yet, as we haven't specified any sources to build.
When building, Unikraft creates a `build/` directory and places all temporary and object files under it;
the application sources are placed under `build/origin/[tarballname]/`.

To tell Unikraft which source files to build, we add files to the `APPNAME_SRCS-y` variable:

```Makefile
APPNAME_SRCS-y += $(APPNAME_BASE)/path_to_src/myfile.c
```

For source files, Unikraft so far supports C (`.c`), C++ (`.cc`, `.cxx`, `.cpp`) and assembly files (`.s`, `.S`).

In case you have pre-compiled object files, you could add them (but due to possible incompatible compilation flags of your pre-compiled object files, you should handle this with care):

```Makefile
APPNAME_OBJS-y += $(APPNAME_BASE)/path_to_src/myobj.o
```

You can also use `APPNAME_OBJS-y` to add pre-built libraries (as `.o` or `.a`):

```Makefile
APPNAME_OBJS-y += $(APPNAME_BASE)/path_to_lib/mylib.a
```

Once you have specified all of your source files (and optionally binary files), it is generally also necessary to specify include paths and compile flags:

```Makefile
# Include paths
APPNAME_ASINCLUDES  += -I$(APPNAME_BASE)/path_to_include/include [for assembly files]
APPNAME_CINCLUDES   += -I$(APPNAME_BASE)/path_to_include/include [for C files]
APPNAME_CXXINCLUDES += -I$(APPNAME_BASE)/path_to_include/include [for C++ files]

# Flags for application sources
APPNAME_ASFLAGS-y   += -DFLAG_NAME1 ... -DFLAG_NAMEN [for assembly files]
APPNAME_CFLAGS-y    += -DFLAG_NAME1 ... -DFLAG_NAMEN [for C files]
APPNAME_CXXFLAGS-y  += -DFLAG_NAME1 ... -DFLAG_NAMEN [for C++ files]
```

With all of these in place, you can save `Makefile.uk`, and type `make`.
Assuming that the chosen Unikraft libraries provide all of the support that your application needs, Unikraft should compile and link everything together, and output one image per target platform specified in the menu.

In addition to all the functionality mentioned, applications might need to perform a number of additional tasks after the sources are downloaded and unpacked, but **before** the compilation takes place (e.g., run a configure script or a custom script that generates source code from source files).
To support this, Unikraft provides the [`UK_PREPARE` variable](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/Makefile#L278), connected to the internal [`prepare` target](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/Makefile#L708), which you can set to a temporary marker file and from there to a target in your `Makefile.uk` file.
For example:

```Makefile
$(APPNAME_BUILD)/.prepared: [dependencies to further targets]
       cmd && $(TOUCH) $@

UK_PREPARE += $(APPNAME_BUILD)/.prepared
```

In this way, you ensure that `cmd` is run before any compilation takes place.
If you use `fetch`, add `$(APPNAME_BUILD)/.origin` as dependency.
If you use `patch`, add `$(APPNAME_BUILD)/.patched` instead.

Furthermore, you may find it necessary to specify compile flags or includes only for a _specific_ source file.
Unikraft supports this through the following syntax:

```Makefile
APPNAME_SRCS-y += $(APPNAME_BASE)/filename.c
APPNAME_FILENAME_FLAGS-y += -DFLAG
APPNAME_FILENAME_INCLUDES-y += -Iextra/include
```

It is also possible to compile a single source file multiple times with different flags.
For this case, Unikraft supports variants:

```Makefile
APPNAME_SRCS-y += $(APPNAME_BASE)/filename.c|variantname
APPNAME_FILENAME_VARIANTNAME_FLAGS-y += -DFLAG2
APPNAME_FILENAME_VARIANTNAME_INCLUDES-y += -Iextra/include
```

<Info>
Note: The build system treats the reserved `isr` variant differently.
This variant is intended for build units that contain code that can also be called from interrupt context.
Separate global architecture flags are used to generate interrupt-safe code (`ISR_ARCHFLAGS-y` instead of `ARCHFLAGS-y`).
Generally, these flags avoid the use of extended machine units which aren't saved by the processor before entering interrupt context (e.g. floating point units, vector units).
</Info>

Finally, you may also need to provide "glue" code, for instance to implement the `main()` function that Unikraft expects you to implement by calling your application's main or init routines.
As a rule of thumb, we suggest to place any such files in the application's main directory (`APPNAME_BASE`), and any includes they may depend on under `APPNAME_BASE/include/`.
And, of course, don't forget to add the source files and include path to `Makefile.uk`.

To see full examples of `Makefile.uk` files, you can browse the available repositories for [applications](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aunikraft-application+org%3Aunikraft&type=Repositories) or [external libraries](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alibrary+org%3Aunikraft&type=Repositories).

Reserved variable names in the name scope are so far:

```

### Config.uk

Unikraft's configuration system is based on [Linux's KConfig system](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/kbuild/kconfig-language.html).
With `Config.uk` you define possible configurations for your application and define dependencies to other libraries.
This file is included by Unikraft to render the menu-based configuration, and to load and store configurations (aka `.config`).
Each setting that is defined in this file will be globally populated as a set variable for all `Makefile.uk` files, as well as a defined macro in your source code when you use `"#include <uk/config.h>"`.
Please ensure that all settings are properly namespaced.
They should begin with `[APPNAME]_` (e.g. `APPHELLOWORLD_`).
Please also note that some variable names are predefined for each application or library namespace (see [`Makefile.uk`](docs/develop/porting/#makefileuk)).

As best practice, we recommend to begin the file with defining dependencies with an invisible boolean option that is set to `y` (i.e. an option that will not be visible in the `menuconfig` screen):

```kconfig
### Invisible option for dependencies
config APPHELLOWORLD_DEPENDENCIES
    bool
    default y
    # dependencies with `select`:
    select LIBNOLIBC if !HAVE_LIBC
    select LIB1
    select LIB2
```

In this example, `LIB1` and `LIB2` would be enabled (the user can't unselect them).
Additionally, if the user did not provide and select any `libc`, the Unikraft internal replacement `nolibc` would be selected.
You can find a documentation of the syntax in the [Linux kernel tree](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.rst).
Of course, you could also directly define a dependency on a particular `libc` (e.g., `libmusl`), instead.
You can also depend on feature flags (like `HAVE_LIBC`) to provide or hide options.
The feature flag `HAVE_LIBC` in this example is set as soon as a proper and full-fledged `libc` was selected by the user.
You can get an overview of available feature flags in `libs/Config.uk`.

Any other setting of your application can be a type of boolean, int, or string.
You are even able to define dropdown-selections.
See [the KConfig documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/kbuild/kconfig-language.html) for details on the syntax.
Please note that Unikraft does not have tristates (the `m` option, for kernel modules, is not available).

```kconfig
  ### App configuration
  config APPHELLOWORLD_OPTION
      bool "Boolean Option 1"
      default y
      help
        Help text of Option 1
```

### exportsyms.uk

Unikraft provides separate namespaces for each library.
This means that every function and variable will only be visible and linkable internally.

To make a symbol visible for other libraries, add it to this `exportsyms.uk` file.
It is simply a flat file, with one symbol name per line.
Line comments may be introduced by the hash character (`#`).

If you are writing an application, you need to add your program entry point to this file.
Most likely nothing else should be there.
For a library, all external API functions must be listed.

For the sake of file structure consistency, it is not recommended to change the default path of this symbols file, unless it is really necessary (e.g., multiple libraries are sharing the same base folder, this symbols file is part of a remotely fetched archive).
You can override it by defining the `APPNAME_EXPORTS` variable.
The path must be either absolute (you can refer with `$(APPNAME_BASE)` to the base directory of your application sources) or relative to the Unikraft sources directory.

<Info>
If no `exportsyms.uk` file is present within a given library (internal or external), all the symbols will be exported by default.
</Info>

### extra.ld

If your library/application needs a section in the final executable image, edit your `Makefile.uk` to add:

```Makefile
LIBYOURAPPNAME_SRCS-$(CONFIG_LIBYOURAPPNAME) += $(LIBYOURAPPNAME_BASE)/extra.ld
```

An example context of `extra.ld`:

```ld
SECTIONS
{
    .uk_fs_list : {
         PROVIDE(uk_fslist_start = .);
         KEEP (*(.uk_fs_list))
         PROVIDE(uk_fslist_end = .);
    }
}
INSERT AFTER .text;
```

This will add the section `.uk_fs_list` after the `.text` section.

## After Porting

After porting an application or library, you can share it with the rest of the community by creating a PR.
You can find more about that on the [contributing page](/docs/contributing/).
