## Unikraft Syscall Shim Layer

The system call shim layer ([`lib/syscall_shim`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/syscall_shim)) provides Linux-style mappings of system call numbers to actual system call handler functions.
You can implement a system call handler by using one of the defined macros (`UK_SYSCALL_DEFINE`, `UK_SYSCALL_R_DEFINE`) and register the system call by adding it to `UK_PROVIDED_SYSCALLS-y` within your `Makefile.uk` file.

The `syscall shim layer` library supports two implementation variants for system call handlers:

1. `libc-style`: The function implementation returns `-1` and sets `errno` in case of errors.

1. `raw`: The function implementation returns a negative error value in case of errors.
   `errno` is not used at all.

Because of the library internals, each system call implementation needs to be provided with both variants.
The build option `Drop unused functions and data` is making sure that all the variants that are compiled-in are actually in use.

You can use helper macros in order to implement the call just once.
The first variant can be implemented with the `UK_SYSCALL_DEFINE` macro:
If you use `UK_SYSCALL_DEFINE`, you should define the `libc-style` system call.

```c
UK_SYSCALL_DEFINE(return_type, syscall_name, arg1_type, arg1_name,
                                             arg2_type, arg2_name, ..)
{
    /* ... */
}
```

For example:

```c
#include <uk/syscall.h>
UK_SYSCALL_DEFINE(ssize_t, write, int, fd, const void *, buf, size_t, count)
{
    ssize_t ret;
    ret = vfs_do_write(fd, buf, count);
    if (ret < 0) {
        errno = EFAULT;
        return -1;
    }
    return ret;
}
```

Raw implementations should use the `UK_SYSCALL_R_DEFINE` macro:

```c
UK_SYSCALL_R_DEFINE(return_type, syscall_name, arg1_type, arg1_name,
                                               arg2_type, arg2_name, ..)
{
    /* ... */
}
```

For example:

```c
#include <uk/syscall.h>
UK_SYSCALL_R_DEFINE(ssize_t, write, int, fd, const void *, buf, size_t, count)
{
    ssize_t ret;
    ret = vfs_do_write(fd, buf, count);
    if (ret < 0) {
        return -EFAULT;
    }
    return ret;
}
```

**Note: in the raw case (`UK_SYSCALL_R_DEFINE`), errors are always returned as negative values.
Whenever the return type is a pointer value, the helpers defined in [`<uk/errptr.h>`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/include/uk/errptr.h) can be used to forward error codes.**

Both macros create the following three symbols:

```c
/* libc-style system call that returns -1 and sets errno on errors */
long uk_syscall_e_<syscall_name>(long <arg1_name>, long <arg2_name>, ...);

/* Raw system call that returns negative error codes on errors */
long uk_syscall_r_<syscall_name>(long <arg1_name>, long <arg2_name>, ...);

/* libc-style wrapper (the same as uk_syscall_e_<syscall_name> but with actual types) */
<return_type> <syscall_name>(<arg1_type> <arg1_name>,
                             <arg2_type> <arg2_name>, ...);
```

In case the libc-style wrapper does not match the signature and return type of the underlying system call, a so called low-level variant of these two macros are available: `UK_LLSYSCALL_DEFINE`, `UK_LLSYSCALL_R_DEFINE`.
These macros only generate the `uk_syscall_e_<syscall_name>` and `uk_syscall_r_<syscall_name>` symbols.
You can then provide the custom libc-style wrapper on top:

```c
#include <uk/syscall.h>

UK_LLSYSCALL_R_DEFINE(ssize_t, write, int, fd, const void *, buf, size_t, count)
{
    ssize_t ret;

    ret = vfs_do_write(fd, buf, count);
    if (ret < 0) {
        return -EFAULT;
    }
    return ret;
}

#if UK_LIBC_SYSCALLS
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count)
{
    return (ssize_t) uk_syscall_e_write((long) fd,
                                        (long) buf, (long) count);
}
#endif /* UK_LIBC_SYSCALLS */
```

<Info>
Please note that the implementation of custom libc-style wrappers has to be guarded with `#if UK_LIBC_SYSCALLS`.
This macro is provided by the [`<uk/syscall.h>`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/blob/staging/lib/syscall_shim/include/uk/syscall.h) header.
Some libc ports (e.g. musl) deactivate this option whenever they provide their own wrapper functions.
For such cases, the `syscall_shim` library will only provide the `uk_syscall_e_<syscall_name>` and `uk_syscall_r_<syscall_name>` symbols.**
</Info>

<Info>
When the `syscall_shim` library is not enabled, the original design idea was that the macros provide the libc-style wrapper only.
However, all the described macros are still available and populate the symbols as documented here.
This is done to support the case that a system call is implemented by calling another.
</Info>

If your library uses an `exportsyms.uk` file, you need to add the three symbols for making them publicly available:

```text
uk_syscall_e_<syscallname>
uk_syscall_r_<syscallname>
<syscallname>
```

In our example:

```text
uk_syscall_e_write
uk_syscall_r_write
write
```

In order to register the system call to `syscall_shim`, add it to `UK_PROVIDED_SYSCALLS-y` with the library `Makefile.uk`:

```makefile
UK_PROVIDED_SYSCALLS-$(CONFIG_<YOURLIB>) += <syscall_name>-<number_of_arguments>
```

The `Makefile.uk` snippet for our example:

```makefile
UK_PROVIDED_SYSCALLS-$(CONFIG_LIBWRITESYS) += write-3
```
