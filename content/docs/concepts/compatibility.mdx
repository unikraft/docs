One challenge with Unikraft is the potential porting effort required for new applications.
To address this, Unikraft includes a **binary-compatibility layer** which allows the running of Linux binaries (ELFs) on top of Unikraft.

For such a layer to work, Unikraft has the explicit goal to comply, as much as possible, with Linux's ABI (_Application Binary Interface_), providing a large range of its system call interface.
Concretely, in Unikraft this is handled through its [**system call shim layer**](/docs/internals/syscall-shim) (also called **syscall shim**), which provides Linux-style mappings of system call numbers to actual system call handler functions.

<Info>
Currently, binary-compatibility is available on x86_64, with work ongoing to make this available for AArch64.
Also note that KVM is currently the only supported hypervisor, with QEMU and Firecracker as VMMs (_Virtual Machine Monitors_).
</Info>

<Warning>
Currently, binaries have to be built as PIE (*Position-Independent Executables*).
This is the default build mode for the majority of Linux distributions, so it shouldn't cause any problems.
</Warning>

<Info>
Note that, because Linux binaries are included, constructing new Linux binaries requires a Linux or Linux-compatible development environment (such as WSL - _Windows Subsystem for Linux_).
This is only the case for building binaries -- prebuilt binaries can be used and the ELF loader app itself can be built on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS).

Binary-compatible apps are located in the Unikraft [application `catalog` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog).

While Linux has over 350 system calls, previous
[studies](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2901318.2901341) have shown through
static analysis that only a subset (224) are needed to run a Ubuntu
installation. This number is actually an overestimation due to various reasons,
including the fact that not all such applications make sense in a unikernel
context (e.g., desktop applications) and the imprecision of static analysis. The
proof is that Unikraft's 160+ syscalls are plenty to run complex applications
such as Redis, SQLite, NGINX, HAProxy, TFLite and Memcached, and languages like
Python, Ruby and Go, to name a few.

The ability to run a wide range of applications and languages is paramount to
how much deployment any unikernel project will see. Unikraft addresses this
directly through what we term autoporting: we use an application's native build
system to build the application against the musl C standard library and link the
resulting object files against Unikraft (see Figure below). For this to work,
Unikraft includes a port of the musl library, which means, since musl is meant
for Linux, that system call support is required. To address this, Unikraft
provides (a modular) system call shim layer along with implementations of a
growing number of syscalls. Unikraft also supports binary compatibility mode,
where unmodified ELFs can be run on top of Unikraft with a slight performance
hit; this functionality will be upstreamed in the future.

## A Trip Down POSIX-Compatibility Lane

As a POSIX-like unikernel, Unikraft strives for a high degree of compatibility
with existing applications by supporting the Linux system call API. Some system
calls are more popular than others and the degree of compatibility of a given
POSIX-like unikernel cannot simply be measured as the percentage of the Linux
system call API it supports.

In a 2016 [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2901318.2901341), Tsai et al.
measured system call usage over the entire set of applications from a typical
Ubuntu/Debian distribution. They concluded that to support 100% of these
applications, 272 system calls needed to be implemented. That number went down
to 202, 145, 81, and 40 system calls for the 90%, 50%, 10% and 1% most popular
applications, respectively, suggesting that a large implementation effort would
be required for an OS aiming at supporting even a small number of applications.

However, in the process of implementing POSIX system calls and checking whether
applications where actually running, we gathered anecdotal evidence that these
requirements were not as stringent as they seemed: whenever a system call is
missing, the default behavior of Unikraft's system call shim layer is to stub it
by returning `ENOSYS`; the result of this was that some applications where
correctly running despite not having some of the system calls they invoked
implemented, so we decided to take a closer look.

### Looking Under the System Call API Hood

To understand this behavior better, we performed a study that uses both dynamic
as well as source-level static analysis. For the dynamic analysis we rely on
seccomp to hook into each system call made by the application and to selectively
disable it, returning either `-ENOSYS` (stubbed) or a success code even though
the system call isn't actually implemented (faked). By monitoring the
success/failure of the traced application, we can determine which system calls
can be stubbed and/or faked. Further, we developed a static analysis tool that
takes as input the application's and dependencies' code (e.g., libc) and outputs
an estimation of the system calls the application may invoke at runtime. As a
baseline we also ran the binary-level static analysis tools used by Tsai et al.

For this initial analysis we focused on 5 applications (Redis, NGINX, Memcached,
SQLite and HAProxy), although we are in the process of adding many more to the
tool.  We selected these because they are (a) popular applications (b) good
candidates for running as a unikernel/cloud environment and (c) they have
thorough benchmarking tools (redis-benchmark, wrk, etc.) and test suites. We use
the benchmarking tools to provide realistic workloads and the test suites good
coverage as we measure which syscalls the applications are making actual use of.

### Results and Insights

Figure 2 below shows, for each application and corresponding benchmarking tool
and test suite, the number of system calls statically identified and dynamically
traced. Traced system calls are broken down between the ones whose
implementation is absolutely required for the application/workload, as well as
the ones that can be stubbed and/or faked.

The key insight is that applications are resilient to a significant portion of
syscalls being stubbed and faked, and that the number of implemented syscalls
they require to correctly run is significantly lower than the output of the
static analysis suggests, let alone the total number of syscalls in the Linux
API. Applications require much fewer system calls to run than a static analysis
would suggest, and much less than the total system calls in the Linux API.

To confirm this, we took a look at the applications' source code: in cases where
the failure of a system call is non-critical for the execution of the program,
the program can detect the error and decide to continue as usual, in which case
stubbing works. This snippet from the Redis code-base is a good example:

```clike
if (getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE,&limit) == -1) {
    serverLog(LL_WARNING,"Unable to obtain the current NOFILE"
        "limit (%s), assuming 1024 and setting the max clients"
        "configuration accordingly.", strerror(errno));
    server.maxclients = 1024-CONFIG_MIN_RESERVED_FDS;
}
```

Here when we stub `getrlimit` or `prlimit64`, Redis handles it gracefully with a
default value. In other cases however, the program can interpret the error code
conservatively and decide to abort, in which case faking usually works (since
the failure of the system call is, in reality, non-critical). This snippet from
the NGINX codebase is a good example of such behavior:

```clike
if (prctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, 1, 0, 0, 0) == -1) {
    ngx_log_error(NGX_LOG_EMERG, cycle->log, ngx_errno,
                  "prctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, 1) failed");
    /* fatal */
    exit(2);
}
```

Here `prctl` fails to force the retaining of capabilities upon UID transition;
in the context of an OS that does not have a user/kernel separation (as is the
case for unikernels), capabilities make little sense and so it is fine to fake
the success of the check.

On average, the proportion of invoked system calls that can be stubbed/faked is
42% for test suites, and 60% for traditional workloads. This shows that the
effort to provide comprehensive (test suite level) support for these popular
applications is relatively limited, and is even lower when considering partial
support i.e. traditional workloads. We observe that the system calls that can be
stubbed/faked vary among applications. As an indication, the number of system
calls that would need to be effectively implemented for all these 5 applications
to be supported is 78 for test suites and only 37 for traditional benchmarks

A second observation is that static analysis produces many false positives and
as such yields a large overestimation of the system calls made by an
application. For example on Redis, binary-level static analysis identifies 89
system calls, vs. 68 dynamically traced from the test suite. These trends are
the same for all programs. This is due to multiple reasons such as dead code but
also the imprecision of binary-level static analysis. A concrete example is when
such analysis encounters a system call wrapper like `setxid`: it may mark all
the possible system calls that can be made through that wrapper as invoked,
independently of those that will actually be made at runtime.

Source-level analysis does not suffer from such issues and as such is more
precise than binary-level techniques. For example, on Redis, source-level static
analysis reports 71 system calls which is close to the 68 traced at runtime on
the test suite. Due to the difficulty of binary-level static analysis, this
technique also suffers from a small number of false negatives. Based solely on
static analysis, the amount of system calls that would need to be implemented to
support all 5 applications is 141 for source-level and 125 for binary-level. We
suspect that this smaller number for binary-level analysis may come from its
false negatives. We conclude that relying solely on static analysis is not
sufficient to get a good understanding of the implementation effort required for
an OS aiming at POSIX-like compatibility.

In all, these results bring a message of hope to the level of
POSIX-compatibility Unikraft, and unikernels more generally, can provide: the
effort, while non-negligible, is not as insurmountable as past studies relying
on static analysis seemed to suggest. Unikraft is constantly striving to
increase its syscall support and thus its ability to run a large set of
mainstream applications.
