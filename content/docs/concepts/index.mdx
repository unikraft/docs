  Unikraft is an alternative system for running your application in the cloud.
  In production environments, it feels no different to managing traditional 
  containers, but how your application is packaged and executed is radically 
  different compared to containers and traditional VMs.

In the following sections, we detail the major concepts that are relevant to
Unikraft.  This text serves to fully conceptualize all information to help you
understand the reasoning behind Unikraft's design and implementation, as well as
serve as reference for its architecture.

## Introduction to unikernels

The high level goal of Unikraft is to be able to build specialized OS images,
known as unikernels, easily, quickly and without time-consuming expert work.  A
key distinction between unikernels and classical monolithic Operating Systems
(OS) is that it is a single-address space binary object: it does not have
separation between kernel and user address spaces which allows for much faster
execution.

Unikernels are specifically designed for use in cloud environments.  In most
production systems often the standard unit of isolation is the VM since this
provides the greatest degree of security for the enclosed application(s).  Its
isolation is made possible directly by hardware primitives instead of OS-level
(software) primitives.  However, a fully virtualized traditional VM is too
heavy for most applications which has led to the container-based model.
Naturally, the evolution of running applications in the cloud has led to the
model where containers are deployed within VMs due to the properties of each
system (seen in (c) in Figure 1).  Kubernetes is a prime example of such
deployment model (nodepools are generally deployed as VMs) and is the _de facto_
orchestration framework container applications.

Unikernels find parallels from the themes developed in early microkernel design
efforts.  For instance, virtualisation techniques offered by [Type-1
hypervisors](/docs/concepts/virtualization) are used today to handle network
multiplexing via grant tables to guest OSes.  Application interaction with the
host architecture, through APIs or IPC mechanisms made available by the libOS,
allows for the control of hardware resources and the proliferation of
application-level resource management when desired.

Unikraft has a size comparable with that of a container, while it retains the
power of a virtual machine, meaning it can directly control the hardware
components (virtualized, or not, if running bare-metal). This gives it an
advantage over classical Operating Systems. Being a special type of operating
system, Unikraft can run bare-metal or over a hypervisor.

The following table makes a comparison between regular virtual machines (think
of an Ubuntu VM), Containers and Unikernels, represented by Unikraft:

|                      | Virtual Machines              | Containers                        | Unikernels                  |
| :------------------: | :---------------------------: | :-------------------------------: | :-------------------------: |
| **Time performance** | Slowest of the 3              | Fast                              | Fast                        |
| **Memory footprint** | Heavy                         | Depends on the number of features | Light                       |
| **Security**         | Very secure                   | Least secure of the 3             | Very secure                 |
| **Features**         | Everything you could think of | Depends on the needs              | Only the absolute necessary |

## Componenization

At the heart of the unikernel model lies with the collection of composable,
inter-changable and interoperable OS components which are formed into a library,
known as a library OS (libOS).  These components can be logically organized in
two types.  The first set of functionalities which enable essential runtime
services, such as system resource virtualisation and device drivers.  The second
type of OS service is discussed in the next section, offering added-value
capabilities to applications, like IP networking and file system access.

In Unikraft, libraries are first-class and all libraries in the core are
inter-changable, from the scheduler to the memory allocator and more.  To
facilitate the use of the wider ecosystem, Unikraft allows for wrapping
pre-existing libraries such as OpenSSL.

## Configurability

To meet the needs of a large variety of different use cases, KPIs and contexts,
configuration of library components allow users to tune specific attributes to
their liking.  This ability to configure all parts of the unikernel is
first-class in Unikraft and enables developers to develop the best-in-class
applications.

In Unikraft, this system is enabled by a custom port of Linux's KConfig
system which allows users to quickly and easily pick and choose which
libraries to include in the build process, as well as to configure options for
each of them, where available.

## Tooling and Integrations

The core of Unikraft is a suite of tools which aid in the creation of the final
unikernel image.  Based on Go, GNU Make, C and KConfig, it takes care of
compiling and linking all the relevant modules and of producing images for the
different platforms selected via the configuration menu.

<Info>
You can get started easily today by installing the command-line companion tool
`kraft` by [following our getting started guide](/docs/cli).

External libraries consist of existing code not specifically meant for Unikraft.
This includes standard libraries such as libc or openssl, but also run-times
like Python.
