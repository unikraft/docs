  Learn about Unikraft's general organization and the steps its build system
  performs to generate a unikernel.

Unikraft is designed to build ultra-lightweight VM images. For that matter, the
build system takes only the crucial pieces of code and binds them together.

The lifecycle of a Unikraft unikernel construction includes several distinct
steps:

1. Configuring the compile-time options for the Unikraft unikernel application;
2. Fetching and preparing the source code for external libraries;
3. Compiling the libraries and core Unikraft code;
4. Linking the final unikernel image.

## GNU Make-based build system

Unikraft is a configurable operating system where we can tune each component to
our liking. To achieve this, Unikraft utilises a Kconfig-based configuration
system through `Config.uk` files. These files include options to enable
libraries, applications, and different components of the Unikraft core. We can
apply these configuration options using `make menuconfig` which generates an
internal configuration file (`.config`) understood by the build system. Once
configured, we can run `make` to build the Unikraft image and run it using any
method of our choice, i.e., Linux ELF loader, qemu-kvm, xen, etc.
