  Learn how Unikraft is generally organized and the steps that are performed by 
  Unikraft's build system which generate a unikernel.

Unikraft is designed to build ultra-lightweight VM images.  For that matter, the
build system is designed to take only the absolute necessary pieces of code and
bind them together.

  the build process to generate a unikernel image."

The lifecycle of the construction of a Unikraft unikernel includes several
distinct steps:

1. Configuring the Unikraft unikernel application with compile-time options;
2. Fetching and preparing the source code for external libraries;
3. Compiling the libraries and the core Unikraft code;
4. Linking the final unikernel image.

## GNU Make-based build system

Unikraft is a configurable operating system, where each component can be
modified, configured, according to the userâ€™s needs. This configuration is done
using a version of Kconfig, through the Config.uk files. In these files, options
are added to enable libraries, applications and different components of the
Unikraft core. The user can then apply those configuration options, using make
menuconfig, which generates an internal configuration file that can be
understood by the build system, .config. Once configured, the Unikraft image can
be built, using make, and run, using the appropriate method (Linux ELF loader,
qemu-kvm, xen, others).
