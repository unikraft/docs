title: Virtualization
description: |
  Through virtualization, multiple operating systems (OSes) are able to run on 
  the same hardware, independently, thinking that each one of them controls the 
  entire system.

Virtualization can be done using a hypervisor, which is a low-level software
that virtualizes the underlying hardware and manages access to the real
hardware, either directly or through the host Operating System. There are 2 main
virtualized environments: virtual machines and containers, each with pros and
cons regarding complexity, size, performance and security. Unikernels come
somewhere between those 2.

## Virtual Machines

A virtual machine represents an abstraction of the hardware, over which an
operating system can run, thinking that it is alone on the system and that it
controls the hardware below it. Virtual machines rely on hypervisors to run
properly.

A hypervisor incorporates hardware-enabled multiplexing and segmentation of
compute resources in order to better utilize, better secure and better
facilitate the instantenous runtime of user-defined programs. By the
means of a virtual machine, an operating system is unaware of the multiplexing
which happens to facilitate its existence. The hypervisor emulates devices on
behalf of the guest OS, including providing access to virtual CPUs, virtual
Interrupt Controllers and virtual NICs, which are segmented from the underlying
hardware.

The hypervisors can be classified in 2 categories: Type 1 and Type 2:

* The **Type 1 hypervisor**, also known as **bare-metal hypervisor**, has direct
  access to the hardware and controls all the operating systems that are running
  on the system. The guest OSes have access to the physical hardware, and the
  hypervisor arbiters this accesses. KVM is an example of Type 1 hypervisor.

* The **Type 2 hypervisor**, also known as **hosted hypervisor**, has to go 
  through the host operating system to reach the hardware. Access to the 
  hardware is emulated, using software components that behave in the same way 
  as the hardware ones. An example of Type 2 hypervisor is VirtualBox.

In Figure 1 a comparison between different virtualization systems is illustrated
and demonstrates how the degree of separation between a "guest application" and
the hardware and “host” becomes further removed. The defined job of the host OS
and kernel or hypervisor became that of 1). to juggle the runtime of multiple
applications and environments; 2). to present a subset or non-contiguous
representation of hardware resources virtually and translate operations, and
provide emulation and compatibility between guest and host; and, 3). to
ultimately guard access to them to prevent corruption or malicious attacks.


## Supported platforms

Unikraft can be run as a virtual machine, using **KVM** (with QEMU 
or Firecracker as VMMs) or **Xen**.
It acts as an operating system, having the responsibility to configure the 
hardware components that it needs (clocks, additional processors, etc).
This mode gives Unikraft direct and total control over hardware components, 
allowing advanced functionalities.

When Unikraft is running using **QEMU-KVM**, it can either be run on an emulated
system or a (para)virtualized one. Technically, **KVM** means virtualization
support is enabled. If using **QEMU** in emulated mode, **KVM** is not used.

Emulation is slower, but it allows using CPU architectures different from the
local one (you can run ARM code on a x86 machine). Using (para)virtualisation,
aka hardware acceleration, greater speed is achieved and more hardware
components are visible to Unikraft.


## Future virtualization support

Unikraft is planned to be able to run on **Hyper-V** and **VMWare**, in the near
future.
