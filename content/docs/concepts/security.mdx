  We are convinced that unikernels have the potential to provide high levels of security, in some cases even better than that of mainstream operating systems.

This page gives an overview of our vision, highlights present security
properties of Unikraft, and the various ongoing efforts to fully achieve
Unikraft's security potential.

## Minimal Attack Surface

Unikraft is characterized by extreme specialization: its images contain only the
code that is strictly necessary for the application to run, resulting in a
drastically reduced attack surface. As an example, a Unikraft production image
contains no shell, no unneeded system services, no unneeded system calls or OS
features, and dead code within used components is significantly reduced by
aggressive compile and link stage optimizations. Even the kernel functionality,
unlike other unikernel projects, is modular, allowing users to easily remove
components (e.g., the network stack) if not needed. While this does not
eliminate all attack vectors, it severely reduces them, especially compared to a
general-purpose OS.

## Strong Cross-Application Isolation

In addition to its attack-surface benefits, Unikraft also provides strong
cross-application isolation: since each Unikraft VM runs a single application,
cross-application isolation is provided by the hypervisor, resulting in
significantly more robust guarantees than processes or Docker containers. This
ultimately means that even in the event that one application has been
compromised, escalating privileges to the rest of the stack/infrastructure will
be much harder for the attacker.

## Safe Languages

Unikernels have historically claimed robustness due to their implementation in
safe languages (e.g., MirageOS with OCaml). Although Unikraft is mainly
implemented in C for performance reasons, it natively supports the
implementation of components in safe languages. For example, we have members of
the community exploring the implementation of a formally verified scheduler in
Dafny, or a safe network stack in Rust. Ultimately, we envision Unikraft-built
unikernels that mix and match heterogeneous components to optimally trade off
security and performance.

## Security Features and Testing: Matching Linux

Because of their intrinsic characteristics, unikernels projects have, in the
past, claimed high security for cloud appliances. However, their security
properties have been [called into
question](https://www.nccgroup.com/media/tgsj1css/_ncc_group-assessing_unikernel_security.pdf),
as existing research prototypes failed to match mainstream OSes' security
features, robustness, and testing. This aspect has historically been overlooked
by unikernel prototypes for many reasons, including the fact that many, if not
most, unikernels projects have been research ones and adding such features would
have had little research value. In contrast, Unikraft has the explicit aim of
targeting real-world deployments, and as such we have, and are putting, effort
into providing such features; we describe these next.

## Unikraft Security Features

In Unikraft, most of the core security features have been merged or are pending merge (e.g., ASLR / PIE, stack protection, ARM pointer authentication, etc.).
This effort is by nature a continuous, community-driven task, but we are expecting completion of most core security features by the end of 2022. An overview of the state of security feature support is shown in the following table:

Note that, as shown in the table, some security features of mainstream OSes do
not apply to Unikraft: this is the case, for example, with numerous software
counter-measures against speculative execution vulnerabilities such as KPTI,
unnecessary because of the presence of a single application in the virtual
machine.

## Testing

In addition to matching mainstream OSes' security features, any unikernel with
production pretensions must have a thorough testing process: this aspect too has
been often overlooked by the unikernel community due to its limited research
value. Unikraft aims to improve on this by adopting state-of-the-art practices
with [a rigorous review of code changes](/docs/contributing/review-process/) and
systematic integration/unit testing with our [public Concourse CI/CD
pipeline](https://builds.unikraft.io). In addition to this, there is an ongoing
effort to systematically and continuously fuzz test Unikraft as is done on
Linux; we aim to write a blog post on this soon.

## Fine-Grained Compartmentalization

Longer term, we are looking into evolving Unikraft into a framework that allows
users to flexibly introduce isolation boundaries within the unikernel to further
increase the security of the system. This is a research direction that we
recently explored with [FlexOS](https://project-flexos.github.io). We developed
a prototype that allows users to easily and safely compartmentalize less
trusted, riskier, or unsafe parts of the application and the kernel with limited
impact on performance, and to easily try a wide range of different design
choices in the security versus performance trade-off space (see graph below:
each column is one such point in the design space).
