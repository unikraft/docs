    question="Why Unikraft and not a container?"
  >
  Unikraft is lightweight and fast, similar to a container, while having the security of a virtual machine.
  Best of both worlds.
  For more details, see the [Performance](/docs/concepts/performance/) and [Security](/docs/concepts/security/) sections.

  <FaqItem
    question="I get the error `Could not access KVM kernel module: No such file or directory`"
  >
  This is caused by missing KVM support.
  This may be the case if:

  * you are running an ARM64 image on x86_64 (or viceversa)
  * you are using a virtual machine for development / deployment
  * you are using Windows (with WSL) or macOS
  * your system simply doesn't have KVM support.

  If you are using `kraft run`, use the `-W` option to disable KVM support requirement.
  If you are using QEMU, be sure to **not** use the `-enable-kvm` nor the `-accel kvm` options.
  Firecracker currently requires KVM support;
  you can't run it on a KVM-less system.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="How do I stop a running QEMU instance?"
  >
  Use `Ctrl+a x` (i.e. press `Ctrl` and `a` keys simultanously, release, then press `x` key) to close an open QEMU instance in the terminal.
  You can also kill all QEMU instances by running, in another console:

  ```console
  pkill -f qemu-system
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="How do I stop a running Firecracker instance?"
  >
  There's no keyboard shortcut to stop a running Firecracker instance.
  You either find out the pid and kill it:

  ```console
  pgrep -f firecracker
  kill <PID>
  ```

  Replace `<PID>` with the actual PID (_Process ID_) returned by `pgrep`.

  You can also kill all Firecracker instances by running, in another console:

  ```console
  pkill -f firecracker
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="How do I stop a running KraftKit instance (started with `kraft run`)?"
  >
  If you use `Ctrl+c` that will close the current KraftKit controlling process, but may not fully remove the runtime information, including potential port mappings and potential started QEMU / Firecracker / Xen processes.

  Use `--rm` as argument to `kraft run` to remove the underlying runtime when using `Ctrl+c`.

  To list all active / inactive KraftKit instances, use:

  ```console
  kraft ps -a
  ```

  To stop an instance or all instances, or to remove an instance or all instances use:

  ```console
  kraft stop <instance_name>
  kraft stop --all
  kraft rm <instance_name>
  kraft rm --all
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I get the error `port 0.0.0.0:8080 is already in use by ...`
    What do I do?"
  >
  There is another instance running that is using port `8080`.

  First, check the listening services to detect what is using the port:

  ```console
  netstat -tlpn
  ```

  That may be a KraftKit instance, a QEMU instance, a Firecracker instance, or something else.
  If it's something else, you can kill it by passing the PID to the `kill` command:

  ```console
  kill <PID>
  ```

  If it's a KraftKit, QEMU or Firecracker instance using the port, you can check the running state:

  ```console
  kraft ps -a
  ps -ef | grep qemu-system
  ps -ef | grep firecracker
  ```

  You can stop them to free the port:

  ```console
  kraft rm <instance_name>
  kill <qemu_PID>
  kill <firecracker_PID>
  ```

  You can also stop all running instances:

  ```console
  kraft rm --all
  pkill -f qemu-system
  pkill -f firecracker
  ```

    question="I want to debug a Unikraft image with QEMU.
    But when I use QEMU (`qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ...qemu-x86_64.dbg`) it says `qemu-system-x86_64: Error loading uncompressed kernel without PVH ELF`."
  >
  This is because you passed the debug image (with the `.dbg` extension) to QEMU.
  You need to pass the actual image (i.e. **without** the `.dgb` extension).
  The image with the `.dbg` extension is used by GDB.

  See more [here](https://unikraft.org/guides/debugging#using-gdb).
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I run an image with QEMU and I get `CRIT: [libkvmplat] 1GiB pages not supported.`"
  >
  It's because you don't use KVM support and large pages are required.
  Pass the `-cpu max` option to `qemu-system-x86_64`.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I am trying to run an application with `kraft run unikraft.org/<app_name>` and I get `W  could not find package 'unikraft.org/nginx' based on qemu/x86_64`"
  >
  You need to also pass the tag, the full command should be:

  ```console
  kraft run unikraft.org/<app_name>:<tag>
  ```

  For example, run:

  ```console
  kraft run unikraft.org/nginx:1.25
  kraft run unikraft.org/ruby:3.2
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="How do I debug a `kraft run` issue?"
  >
  If there is an issue with the `kraft run` commnd, get more info by using the `--log-level debug --log-type basic` options:

  ```console
  kraft run --log-level debug --log-type basic --rm ...
  ```

  **Note**: Place the `--log-level debug --log-type basic` options **immediately** after `kraft run`, as in the command above.

  In case of an issue with running QEMU / Firecracker, you should see the generated command line, pointing you to a log file.
  For example, for QEMU, you will get something like:

  ```text
  qemu-system-x86_64 [...] -serial file:/home/razvand/.local/share/kraftkit/runtime/f93556bb-3cd1-45da-beac-075d1b123a3b/machine.log
  ```

  The `machine.log` file may contain useful information related to the runtime issue:

  ```text
  cat /home/razvand/.local/share/kraftkit/runtime/f93556bb-3cd1-45da-beac-075d1b123a3b/machine.log
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="When I run an app I get `E: machine fatally exited`."
  >
  It's very likely you didn't provide enough memory.
  Investigate further by using the `--log-level debug --log-type basic` options to `kraft run`:

  ```console
  kraft run --log-level debug --log-type basic --rm ...
  ```

  Use the `-M` option to `kraft run`, e.g.:

  ```console
  kraft run --rm -M 256M unikraft.org/ruby:3.2
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="When I run an app I get `CRIT: [libvfscore] Failed to extract cpio archive to /: -3`."
  >
  As above, it's very likely you didn't provide enough memory.
  Use the `-M` option to `kraft run`, e.g.:

  ```console
  kraft run --rm -M 256M unikraft.org/ruby:3.2
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I'm trying to run applications using instructions at `http://github.com/unikraft/app-...` and I have problems."
  >
  The `app-...` repositories are archived and no longer in use.
  Visit the [`catalog` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) and see applications and examples there.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I'm trying to port / run a new application on Unikraft.
    What should I do?"
  >
  Your goal should be to add the appplication to the [`catalog` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog).
  Follow these guides:

  * [Using the Application Catalog](https://unikraft.org/guides/using-the-app-catalog)
  * [Behind the Scenes with the Application Catalog](https://unikraft.org/guides/catalog-behind-the-scenes)
  * [Adding Applications to the Catalog](https://unikraft.org/docs/contributing/adding-to-the-app-catalog)

    question="Whenever I run `kraft build` or `kraft run` it takes a lot of time to build the required filesystem from the `Dockerfile`.
    How can I speed that up?"
  >
  In its default configuration, KraftKit will start a temporary / transient [BuildKit instance](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/).

  To speed things up, start a more permanent BuildKit instance that will cache the built filesystems.
  Follow the instruction [here](https://unikraft.org/guides/building-dockerfile-images-with-buildkit) to start a more permanent BuildKit instance.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I think things are pretty messed up and I want to clear all KraftKit related configurations and files.
    What do I do?"
  >
  Use the commands below to clear all KraftKit-related information and then refresh it.

  ```console
  kraft rm --all
  kraft pkg rm --all
  rm -fr ~/.local/share/kraftkit/
  kraft pkg ls --apps --update
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="When I use `kraft build` I don't seem to get the latest version of the repositories."
  >

  Make sure you remove the local configuration and output files beforehand:

  ```console
  rm -f config*
  rm -fr .unikraft
  ```

  There are cached version of repositories.
  You can clean the KraftKit setup with the steps above:

  ```console
  kraft rm --all
  kraft pkg rm --all
  rm -fr ~/.local/share/kraftkit/
  kraft pkg ls --apps --update
  ```

  Otherwise, request `kraft build` to use only fresh images:

  ```console
  kraft build --no-cache --no-update ...
  ```
