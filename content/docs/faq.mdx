    question="Some steps fail when trying to build - run a Unikraft application."
  >
  First, ask in the community about the problem you encountered.
  Most of the time, the issues are common, and known in the community.
  You can also do some debugging on your own.
  For details, see the [Debugging](/docs/internals/debugging/) section.

    question="Why Unikraft and not a container?"
  >
  Unikraft is lightweight, faster than a container, while having the security of a virtual machine.
  Best of both worlds.
  For more details, see the [Performance](/docs/concepts/performance/) and [Security](/docs/concepts/security/) sections.

  <FaqItem
    question="I get the error `Could not access KVM kernel module: No such file or directory`"
  >
  This is caused by missing KVM support.
  This may be the case if:

  * you are running an ARM64 image on x86_64 (or viceversa)
  * you are using a virtual machine for development / deployment
  * you are using Windows (with WSL) or macOS
  * your system simply doesn't have KVM support.

  If you are using `kraft run`, use the `-W` option to disable KVM support requirement.
  If you are using QEMU, be sure to **not** use the `-enable-kvm` nor the `-accel kvm` options.
  Firecracker currently requires KVM support;
  you can't run it on a KVM-less system.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="How do I stop a running QEMU instance?"
  >
  Use `Ctrl+a x` (i.e. press `Ctrl` and `a` keys simultanously, release, then press `x` key) to close an open QEMU instance in the terminal.
  You can also kill all QEMU instances by running, in another console:

  ```console
  pkill -f qemu-system
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="How do I stop a running Firecracker instance?"
  >
  There's no keyboard shortcut to stop a running Firecracker instance.
  You either find out the pid and kill it:

  ```console
  pgrep -f firecracker
  kill <PID>
  ```

  Replace `<PID>` with the actual PID (_Process ID_) returned by `pgrep`.

  You can also kill all Firecracker instances by running, in another console:

  ```console
  pkill -f firecracker
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="How do I stop a running KraftKit instance (started with `kraft run`)?"
  >
  If you use `Ctrl+c` that will close the current KraftKit controlling process, but may not fully remove the runtime information, including potential port mappings and potential started QEMU / Firecracker / Xen processes.

  Use `--rm` as argument to `kraft run` to remove the underlying runtime when using `Ctrl+c`.

  To list all active / inactive KraftKit instances, use:

  ```console
  kraft ps -a
  ```

  To stop an instance or all instances, or to remove an instance or all instances use:

  ```console
  kraft stop <instance_name>
  kraft stop --all
  kraft rm <instance_name>
  kraft rm --all
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I get the error `port 0.0.0.0:8080 is already in use by ...`
    What do I do?"
  >
  There is another instance running that is using port `8080`.

  First, check the listening services to detect what is using the port:

  ```console
  netstat -tlpn
  ```

  That may be a KraftKit instance, a QEMU instance, a Firecracker instance, or something else.
  If it's something else, you can kill it by passing the PID to the `kill` command:

  ```console
  kill <PID>
  ```

  If it's a KraftKit, QEMU or Firecracker instance using the port, you can check the running state:

  ```console
  kraft ps -a
  ps -ef | grep qemu-system
  ps -ef | grep firecracker
  ```

  You can stop them to free the port:

  ```console
  kraft rm <instance_name>
  kill <qemu_PID>
  kill <firecracker_PID>
  ```

  You can also stop all running instances:

  ```console
  kraft rm --all
  pkill -f qemu-system
  pkill -f firecracker
  ```

    question="I want to debug a Unikraft image with QEMU.
    But when I use QEMU (`qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ...qemu-x86_64.dbg`) it says `qemu-system-x86_64: Error loading uncompressed kernel without PVH ELF`."
  >
  This is because you passed the debug image (with the `.dbg` extension) to QEMU.
  You need to pass the actual image (i.e. **without** the `.dgb` extension).
  The image with the `.dbg` extension is used by GDB.

  See more [here](https://unikraft.org/guides/debugging#using-gdb).
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I run an image with QEMU and I get `CRIT: [libkvmplat] 1GiB pages not supported.`"
  >
  It's because you don't use KVM support and large pages are required.
  Pass the `-cpu max` option to `qemu-system-x86_64`.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I am trying to run an application with `kraft run unikraft.org/<app_name>` and I get `W  could not find package 'unikraft.org/nginx' based on qemu/x86_64`"
  >
  You need to also pass the tag, the full command should be:

  ```console
  kraft run unikraft.org/<app_name>:<tag>
  ```

  For example, run:

  ```console
  kraft run unikraft.org/nginx:1.25
  kraft run unikraft.org/ruby:3.2
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="When I run an app I get `CRIT: [libvfscore] Failed to extract cpio archive to /: -3`."
  >
  You didn't provide enough memory.
  Use the `-M` option to `kraft run`, e.g.:

  ```console
  kraft run -M 256M unikraft.org/ruby:3.2
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I'm trying to run applications using instructions at `http://github.com/unikraft/app-...` and I have problems."
  >
  The `app-...` repositories are archived and no longer in use.
  Visit the [`catalog` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) and see applications and examples there.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I'm trying to port / run a new application on Unikraft.
    What should I do?"
  >
  Your goal should be to add the appplication to the [`catalog` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog).
  Follow these guides:

  * [Using the Application Catalog](https://unikraft.org/guides/using-the-app-catalog)
  * [Behind the Scenes with the Application Catalog](https://unikraft.org/guides/catalog-behind-the-scenes)
  * [Adding Applications to the Catalog](https://unikraft.org/docs/contributing/adding-to-the-app-catalog)

    question="Whenever I run `kraft build` or `kraft run` it takes a lot of time to build the required filesystem from the `Dockerfile`.
    How can I speed that up?"
  >
  In its default configuration, KraftKit will start a temporary / transient [BuildKit instance](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/).

  To speed things up, start a more permanent BuildKit instance that will cache the built filesystems.
  Follow the instruction [here](https://unikraft.org/guides/building-dockerfile-images-with-buildkit) to start a more permanent BuildKit instance.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="I think things are pretty messed up and I want to clear all KraftKit related configurations and files.
    What do I do?"
  >
  Use the commands below to clear all KraftKit-related information and then refresh it.

  ```console
  kraft rm --all
  kraft pkg rm --all
  rm -fr ~/.local/share/kraftkit/
  kraft pkg ls --apps --update
  ```

  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem
    question="When I use `kraft build` I don't seem to get the latest version of the repositories."
  >

  Make sure you remove the local configuration and output files beforehand:

  ```console
  rm -f config*
  rm -fr .unikraft
  ```

  There are cached version of repositories.
  You can clean the KraftKit setup with the steps above:

  ```console
  kraft rm --all
  kraft pkg rm --all
  rm -fr ~/.local/share/kraftkit/
  kraft pkg ls --apps --update
  ```

  Otherwise, request `kraft build` to use only fresh images:

  ```console
  kraft build --no-cache --no-update ...
  ```
