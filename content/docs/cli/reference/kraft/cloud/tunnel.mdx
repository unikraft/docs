description: Forward a local port to an unexposed instance
---

Forward a local port to an unexposed instance through an intermediate TLS
tunnel service.

When you need to access an instance on Unikraft Cloud which is not
publicly exposed to the internet, you can use the
`kraft cloud tunnel` subcommand to forward from a local port to a
port which the instance listens on.

The `kraft cloud tunnel` subcommand creates a secure tunnel
between your local machine and the private instance(s).  The tunnel is
created using an intermediate TLS tunnel service which is another instance
running as a sidecar along with the target instance in the same private
network.  The tunnel service listens on a publicly exposed port on the
cloud and forwards the traffic to the private instance.

When you run the `kraft cloud tunnel` subcommand, you specify the
local port to forward, the private instance to connect to, and the port on
the private instance to connect to.

It is also possible to customize the remote port which the tunnel service
exposes and the command-and-control port used by the tunnel service.  By
default, the remote port is `4444` and the command-and-control
port is `4443`.


```
kraft cloud tunnel [FLAGS] [LOCAL_PORT:]<INSTANCE|PRIVATE_IP|PRIVATE_FQDN>:DEST_PORT[/TYPE] ...
```

### Examples

```
# Forward to the TCP port of `8080` of the unexposed instance
# identified by its name "nginx" which then becomes locally accessible
# also at `8080`:
$ kraft cloud tunnel nginx:8080

# Forward to the TCP port of 8080 of the unexposed instance based on its
# private FQDN `nginx.internal` which then becomes locally
# accessible also at `8080`:
$ kraft cloud tunnel nginx.internal:8080

# Forward to the TCP port of `8080` of the unexposed instance
# based on its private IP `172.16.28.8` which then becomes locally
# accessible also at `8080`:
$ kraft cloud tunnel 172.16.28.8:8080

# Forward to the UDP port of `8123` of the unexposed instance
# based on its private IP `172.16.22.2` which then becomes locally
# accessible also at `8123`:
$ kraft cloud tunnel 172.16.22.2:8123/udp

# Forward to the TCP port of `8080` of the unexposed instance by
# its name "nginx" which then becomes locally accessible at
# `8333`:
$ kraft cloud tunnel 8333:nginx:8080

# Forward multiple ports from multiple instances
$ kraft cloud tunnel 8080:my-instance1:8080/tcp 8443:my-instance2:8080/tcp

# In the circumstance where the port you wish to connect to of the
# instance is the same as the remote port exposed by the tunnelling
# service (or the the command-and-control port of the tunneling service),
# you can use the -p and -P flag to set alternative relay and command-
# and-control ports.
#
# Tunnel to the instance 'my-instance' on port 8080 via the intermediate
# 5500 port
$ kraft cloud tunnel -p 5500 my-instance:8080

```
