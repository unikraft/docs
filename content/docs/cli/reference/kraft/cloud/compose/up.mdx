Deploy services in a compose project to Unikraft Cloud

Use an existing `Composefile` or `docker-compose.yaml` file to start a
number of services as instances on Unikraft Cloud.

Note that this is an experimental command and not all attributes of the
`Composefile` are supported nor are all flags identical.


```
kraft cloud compose up [FLAGS] [COMPONENT]
```

### Examples

```
# Build and deploy a Compose project on Unikraft Cloud.
$ kraft cloud compose up

# Build and deploy the nginx service from a Compose project on
# Unikraft Cloud.
$ kraft cloud compose up nginx component

# (If applicable) Set or override a runtime for a particular service
$ kraft cloud compose up --runtime app=base:latest

```

## Options

```
  -d, --detach                  Run the services in the background
  -h, --help                    help for up
      --no-build                Do not build the services before starting them
      --rollout-wait duration   Time to wait before performing rolling out action (ms/s/m/h) (default 10s)
      --runtime strings         Alternative runtime to use when packaging a service
  -w, --wait duration           Timeout to wait for the instance to start (ms/s/m/h)
