title: Kraftfile Reference (v0.6)
description: |
  This document contains information about how to write a `Kraftfile` which is
  used to configure, build, package and deploy your application as a Unikraft
  unikernel.
---

<Info>
This document contains the latest `Kraftfile` specification information.
</Info>

The `Kraftfile` is the static configuration file used to programmatically build, run, package and deploy a unikernel using `kraft`.
This document contains information about how to set that configuration including how to program Unikraft's core build system, third-party libraries, syntax options and more.

A `Kraftfile` is typically found at the top-level of a repository.
It is possible to change this location using `-K|--kraftfile` in relevant sub-commands of `kraft`.


## File names

For legacy reasons, the following file names are automatically recognized by `kraft` where `Kraftfile` is the latest preferred name:

* `Kraftfile`
* `kraft.yaml`
* `kraft.yml`

## Top-level `spec` attribute

All `Kraftfile`s MUST include a top-level `spec` attribute which is used by `kraft` to both validate as well as correctly parse the rest of the file.
The latest spec number is `v0.6`:

```yaml
spec: v0.6
```

The `spec` element, for legacy reasons, can also be specified as `specification`, for example:

```yaml
specification: v0.6
```

## Top-level `name` attribute

An application `name` CAN specified, for example:

```yaml ln={3}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld
```

When no `name` attribute is specified, the directory's base name is used.
In some cases, a `--name` flag can also be used, e.g. in [`kraft pkg`](/docs/cli/reference/kraft/pkg) and [`kraft cloud deploy`](/docs/cli/reference/kraft/cloud/deploy).

## Top-level `outdir` attribute

An output directory `outdir` CAN be specified, for example:

```yaml ln={3}
spec: v0.6

outdir: ./out
```

This changes the location of build artifacts when running `kraft build` or `kraft pkg`.
The default location when unspecified is set to `./.unikraft/build/`.


## Top-level `cmd` attribute

A `cmd` attribute CAN be specified as an array or string which can be used for setting default arguments to be used during the instantiation of a new unikernel instance.

### Specified as an in-line array

```yaml ln={3}
spec: v0.6

cmd: ["-c", "/nginx/conf/nginx.conf"]
```

### Specified as a multi-line array

```yaml ln={3-5}
spec: v0.6

cmd:
- -c
- /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```

### Specified as a string

```yaml ln={3}
spec: v0.6

cmd: "-c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf"
```

### Specifying kernel parameters

The `cmd` attribute [respects the Unikraft `uklibparam` convention](/blog/2023-05-15-unikraft-releases-atlas#rewriting-uklibparam-867) of separating kernel arguments from application arguments via the `--` delimiter, for example as a multi-line array:

```yaml ln={6-7}
spec: v0.6

cmd:
# Kernel arguments
- env.vars=[ "HOME=/" ]
# Delimiter
- --
# Application arguments
- -c
- /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```


## Top-level `env` attribute

An `env` attribute CAN be provided which injects environmental variables to the application.

Compared to when specifying them in the `cmd` attribute (as seen in [specifying kernel parameters](#specifying-kernel-parameters)), using the `env` attribute is a lot more context-aware.
`kraft` recognizes where it can be best injected, for example, embedded as static variables during build-time, as OCI environmental variables when packaging, as command-line arguments, etc.

### Specified as a list

```yaml ln={3-5,4}
spec: v0.6

env:
- HOME=/
```

### Specified as a dictionary

```yaml ln={3-5,4}
spec: v0.6

env:
  HOME: /
```


## Top-level `labels` attribute

A `labels` attribute CAN be specified which injects arbitrary key-value labels which are set during the packaging step:

```yaml ln={3-5,7-9}
spec: v0.6

labels:
  key: value
```


## Top-level `volumes` attribute

<Info>
Read the main [document on enabling, using and seeding filesystems](/docs/cli/filesystem) in your application with Unikraft.
</Info>

A `volumes` attribute CAN be specified to declare the list of runtime mounts which are provided to the unikernel machine instance.

In all cases when specifying the `volumes` element, there are two forms of syntax that can be used in the `Kraftfile`, known as "short-hand" and "long-hand" depending on preference.

When specifying a destination path, this MUST be represented as an absolute path.


### Short-hand syntax

In its most simple form, a source path on the host is mapped to a destination path in the unikernel using a colon (`:`) delimiter.
For every item in the list of volumes, the source is automatically inspected to determine its driver.

```yaml ln={3-4}
spec: v0.6

volumes:
- ./src:/dest
```

In the above example, `./src` represents a path which points to a directory on the host which is made possible via the [9P File System driver](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/9pfs).

### Long-hand syntax

```yaml ln={3-7}
spec: v0.6

volumes:
- source: ./src
  destination: /dest
  driver: 9pfs
  readOnly: false
```

## Top-level `rootfs` attribute

<Info>
Read the main [document on enabling, using and seeding filesystems](/docs/cli/filesystem) in your application with Unikraft.
</Info>

The `rootfs` element CAN be specified to define the root filesystem.
In every case of being specified, the resulting artifact which is passed to the unikernel machine instance is a read-only [CPIO archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpio).
Depending on the provided path, `kraft` will dynamically serialize the path into such an archive.

The provided path to the `rootfs` element can be one of the following:

- [A path to existing CPIO archive (initramfs file)](#specifying-an-existing-cpio-archive-initramfs-file);
- [A path to a directory](#specifying-a-directory) which is then dynamically serialized into a CPIO archive; or,
- [A path to a `Dockerfile`](#specifying-a-dockerfile) which will be constructed via [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) and then dynamically serialized into a CPIO archive.
  [Learn more about how to enable this feature in KraftKit](/docs/cli/filesystem#using-a-dockerfile-as-a-static-root-filesystem).
- [A path to a tarball](#specifying-a-tarball) which will extract and repackage the tarball as a CPIO archive.  In the future we plan to support [tarballs and other file system types directly as initramfs](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/issues/1571).

When invoking `kraft build` or `kraft run` and the provided path of the `rootfs` is either a directory or a `Dockerfile`, the resulting filesystem will be dynamically serialized and stored in `.unikraft/build/initramfs.cpio`.

### Specifying an existing CPIO archive (initramfs file)

```yaml ln={3}
spec: v0.6

rootfs: ./initramfs.cpio
```

### Specifying a directory

```yaml ln={3}
spec: v0.6

rootfs: ./rootfs/
```

### Specifying a `Dockerfile`

```yaml ln={3}
spec: v0.6

rootfs: ./Dockerfile
```

### Specifying a tarball

```yaml ln={3-4,6-7}
spec: v0.6

# An uncompressed tarball
rootfs: ./rootfs.tar

# A compressed tarball
rootfs: ./rootfs.tar.gz
```


## Top-level `unikraft` attribute

The `unikraft` attribute CAN be specified and is used to define the source location of the [Unikraft core](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft) which contains the main build system and core primitives for connecting your application as well as any third-party libraries or drivers and building the two together "from source".

<Warning>
If no `unikraft` element is specified, one of either [`template`](#top-level-template-attribute) or [`runtime`](#top-level-runtime-attribute) MUST otherwise be specified.
</Warning>

In all cases when specifying the `unikraft` element, there are two forms of syntax that can be used in the `Kraftfile`, known as "short-hand" and "long-hand" depending on preference.


### Setting a specific version

The attribute can be specified in multiple ways, the most common is simply to request the latest from a "stable" channel of Unikraft, e.g.:

```yaml ln={5-6,8-10}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

# Short-hand syntax
unikraft: stable

# Long-hand syntax
unikraft:
  version: stable
```

<Info>
The Unikraft project adopts two-channel release mode via `stable` and `staging`.
Specifying the latter will provide to you bleeding-edge version of Unikraft.
</Info>

To specify a specific version of Unikraft, including a specific Git commit, you simply set it as follows:

```yaml ln={5-6,8-10,12-13,15-17}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

# Short-hand for a specific version of Unikraft
unikraft: v0.14.0

# Long-hand for a specific version of Unikraft
unikraft:
  version: v0.14.0

# Short-hand for a specific commit of Unikraft
unikraft: 70bc0af

# Long-hand for a specific commit of Unikraft
unikraft:
  version: 70bc0af
```


### Setting a specific source location

If you wish to use a copy of the Unikraft core code which is a remote fork or mirror, it is possible to set this as the entry for the attribute.
When specified like so, the top of the HEAD of the default branch will be used:

```yaml ln={5-6,8-10}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

# Short-hand syntax
unikraft: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git

# Long-hand syntax
unikraft:
  source: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
```

Alternatively, a specific tag, branch or Git SHA can be specified by setting:

```yaml ln={5-6,8-11,13-14,16-19,21-22,24-27}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

# Short-hand syntax for a specific branch
unikraft: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git@staging

# Long-hand syntax for a specific branch
unikraft:
  source: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  version: staging

# Short-hand syntax for a specific tag
unikraft: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git@RELEASE-0.14.0

# Long-hand syntax for a specific ta
unikraft:
  source: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  version: RELEASE-0.14.0

# Short-hand syntax for a specific commit
unikraft: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git@70bc0af

# Long-hand syntax for a specific commit
unikraft:
  source: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  version: 70bc0af0bd1c74b3af3c0584d7b7373dc42b2ce7
```

It is possible to access remote repositories which requires authentication over SSH, simply set this as part of the scheme:

```yaml ln={5-7,9-13}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

# Short-hand syntax for specifying an authenticated Git repository over SSH,
# which will select the default branch
unikraft: ssh://git@github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git

# Long-hand syntax for specifying an authenticated Git repository over SSH, and
# specifying a specific branch (or tag)
unikraft:
  source: ssh://git@github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  version: staging
```

<Info>
To use Git authentication over SSH, you must start an SSH agent before invoking `kraft`, for example:

```console
eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
</Info>

Finally, it is possible to set the location of Unikraft's core to a path on the host.
This is useful when you are hacking at the core directly or working whilst traveling and do not have access to an internet connection:

```yaml ln={5-6,8-11}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

# Short-hand sytnax for a specific path on disk
unikraft: path/to/unikraft

# Long-hand syntax for a specific path on disk
unikraft:
  source: path/to/unikraft
```

### Specifying KConfig configuration

To declare any specific options from Unikraft's configuration system, you must always use the long-hand syntax.
All KConfig options start with `CONFIG_` and can be set in either list format with key and value delimetered with an equal (`=`) symbol or in map format:

```yaml ln={5-8,10-13}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

# Using list-style formatting
unikraft:
  kconfig:
  - CONFIG_EXAMPLE=y

# Using map-style formatting
unikraft:
  kconfig:
    CONFIG_EXAMPLE: "y"
```

### A more complex example

All three sub-attributes, `source`, `version` and `kconfig`, can be used together to generate a very specific definition of the Unikraft core:

```yaml ln={5-9}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

unikraft:
  source: https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  version: stable
  kconfig:
    CONFIG_EXAMPLE: "y"
```

## Top-level `runtime` attribute

The `runtime` attribute CAN be specified and is used to access a pre-built unikernel.
The unikernel runtime can be specified either as a path to [an OCI image](/docs/cli/packaging#oci-based-packages), a directory representing a project (i.e. one which contains a `Kraftfile`) or a path to a unikernel binary image.

<Warning>
If no `runtime` element is specified, one of either [`template`](#top-level-template-attribute) or [`unikraft`](#top-level-unikraft-attribute) MUST otherwise be specified.
</Warning>

The `runtime` attribute is a powerful primitive for re-using pre-built unikernel images.
Whilst the `unikraft` element allows for ultimate customization of the unikernel binary, this is not always necessary for new projects.
For example, you may wish to simply program a Python3 application and not wish to

a) build the unikernel representing the python3 runtime for all projects
b) care not for making customizations to the kernel at all

The Unikraft Open-Source Project hosts a public access unikernel registry of images which can be viewed directly in your terminal.
Simply call the following to see the latest applications:

```bash
kraft pkg ls --apps --update
```

To view applications for different platforms and architecture which do not match your host:

```bash
kraft pkg ls --apps --update --all
```

<Info>
All of these applications are built openly in our [community catalog](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog).
</Info>

To get started using an existing runtime, which represents either an off-the-shelf application such as NGINX or Redis, or a high-level language runtime such as Python3 or Ruby, you can simply set the name of the image in the `runtime` element:

```yaml ln={3}
spec: v0.6

runtime: unikraft.org/python3:latest
```

The `runtime` element can be used as simply as the above snippet but becomes more useful when [customizing the filesystem](/docs/cli/filesystem).
For example, loading a Python3 application into the filesystem and setting the path to the application to execute:

```yaml
spec: v0.6

runtime: unikraft.org/python3:latest

volumes:
- ./src:/src

cmd: ["/src/main.py"]
```

The above example can then simply be executed with `kraft run`.


## Top-level `template` attribute

The `template` attribute CAN be specified to reference an external repository which contains an application based on another `Kraftfile`.
This offers a convenient mechanism for customizing or re-using configuration or files across multiple applications.

<Warning>
If no `template` element is specified, one of either [`runtime`](#top-level-runtime-attribute) or [`unikraft`](#top-level-unikraft-attribute) MUST otherwise be specified.
</Warning>

When using a template, the source of the template can be qualified by either specifying [a component of type-application](/docs/cli/packaging#package-component-types) or as a path to a repository representing an application (whether on disk or remotely via Git).

Just like libraries and the `unikraft` element, the template is a component which can be expressed using different different syntaxes.
If an application has been previously [sourced via `kraft pkg source`](/docs/cli/packaging#sourcing-additional-packages) then the template can be specified as simply as:

```yaml ln={3-4,6-9}
spec: v0.6

# Short-hand syntax
template: app/elfloader:stable

# Long-hand syntax
template:
  name: elfloader
  version: stable
```

Alternatively, the application can be specified:

```yaml
# As a remote Git repository:
template: https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader.git
```
```yaml
# As a tarball representing an application repository:
template: https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader/archive/refs/heads/stable.tar.gz
```
```yaml
# Or finally as a directory on your host representing an application:
template: /home/unikraft/apps/elfloader
```

The process of applying the template's `Kraftfile` on top of another is achieved with an overlay mechanism.
This means that elements which are included in the top-level `Kraftfile` will overwrite the template's when specified.
For example, given the above top-level `Kraftfile` with no additional attributes, the template's attributes will be used verbatim.

To demonstrate the overlay approach, let's assume the following template with a top-level `unikraft` element and some `targets`:

```yaml
spec: 0.6

name: template

unikraft:
  version: stable
  kconig:
  - CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE=y

targets:
- qemu/x86_64
```

This template can be referenced as `app/template:stable` when sourced as a component via the package manager.
When using a new top-level `Kraftfile` which references said template, we can make adjustments to the `unikraft` attribute, for example:

```yaml
spec: 0.6

template: app/template:stable

unikraft:
  version: staging
```

This will result in

```diff
  spec: 0.6

- template: app/template:stable
-
- unikraft:
-   version: stable
-   kconig:
-   - CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE=y 
+
+ name: template
+
+ unikraft:
+   version: staging
+
+ targets:
+ - qemu/x86_64
```

Which results in:

```yaml
spec: 0.6

name: template

unikraft:
  version: staging

targets:
- qemu/x86_64
```


## Top-level `libraries` attributes

Additional third-party libraries CAN be specified as part of the build and are listed in map-format.
Similar to the `unikraft` attribute, each library can specify a `source`, `version` and a set of `kconfig` options, for example:

```yaml ln={8-9,11-26}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

unikraft: stable

libraries:
  # Short-hand syntax for specifying the library "musl" on the stable channel
  musl: stable

  # Long-hand syntax for specifying a library at a specified source, using a
  # specific Git branch, and specifying additional KConfig options
  lwip:
    source: https://github.com/unikraft/lib-lwip.git
    version: stable
    kconfig:
      CONFIG_LWIP_AUTOIFACE: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_DHCP: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_DNS: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_IPV4: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_SOCKET: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_TCP_KEEPALIVE: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_TCP: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_THREADS: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_UKNETDEV: "y"
      CONFIG_LWIP_WND_SCALE: "y"
```

In the above example, two additional libraries are used, [`musl`](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl) and [`lwip`](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-lwip).
The names of these libraries are determined by what is [sourced via `kraft`'s package manager](/docs/cli/packaging#listing-and-searching-for-packages).


## Top-level `targets` attributes

A target is defined as a specific destination that the resulting unikernel is destined for and consists at minimum of a specific platform (e.g. `qemu` or `firecracker`) and architecture (e.g. `x86_64` or `arm64`) tuple.
A project can have multiple targets depending on use case but MUST have at least one. 

Each target consists of at minimum an architecture and platform combination, therefore a project with two targets of `qemu/x86_64` and `xen/arm64`:

```yaml ln={8-9,11-12}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

unikraft: stable

targets:
- plat: qemu
  arch: x86_64

- plat: xen
  arch: arm64
```

Within the list of `targets`, the `architecture` and `platform` attributes can be abbreviated to `arch` and `plat`, respectively, and be used interchangeably:

```yaml
targets:
- plat: qemu
  arch: x86_64
```

```yaml
targets:
- plat: qemu
  architecture: x86_64
```

```yaml
targets:
- platform: qemu
  arch: x86_64
```

The list of targets can now accept an even shorter syntax where only the architecture and platform are desired in the list:

```yaml
targets:
- qemu/x86_64
```

This shorthand syntax can be mixed with full target elements:

```yaml
targets:
- qemu/x86_64
- platform: qemu
  architecture: arm64
- plat: fc
  arch: x86_64
```

When left without any flags, `kraft build` will prompt you for the intended target to build.

It is possible to define targets simply based on different runtime properties or requirements.
This is possible by setting both a `name` sub-attribute and a set of `Kconfig` options, for example the following two targets both target `qemu/x86_64` platform/architecture tuple but initialize the rootfs either based on 9pfs or initrd, respectively:


```yaml ln={8-15,17-24}
spec: v0.6

name: helloworld

unikraft: stable

targets:
- name: helloworld-qemu-x86_64-9pfs
  plat: qemu
  arch: x86_64
  kconfig:
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_AUTOMOUNT_ROOTFS: "y"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS_9PFS: "y"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS: "9pfs"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTDEV: "fs0"

- name: helloworld-qemu-x86_64-initrd
  plat: qemu
  arch: x86_64
  kconfig:
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_AUTOMOUNT_ROOTFS: "y"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS_INITRD: "y"
    CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_ROOTFS: "initrd"
```
