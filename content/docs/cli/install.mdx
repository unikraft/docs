description: |
  With `kraft`, you can easily leverage Unikraft and manage specialized, 
  high-performance applications at every stage of their lifecycle: from 
  construction to production.
---

Whilst the target architecture and platform for the unikernel may differ from
your host system, `kraft` itself can be used on the following supported systems
to build and package unikernels.


## Recommended installation method

You can quickly and easily install KraftKit using the interactive installer.
Simply run the following command to get started: 

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.kraftkit.sh | sh
```

The above script will identify your host and guide you through an the
installation process, including suggestions for how to receive updates.  The
installer will try to use your native package manager.


## macOS

The simplest way to install `kraft` on macOS is via `brew`:

```
brew install unikraft/cli/kraftkit
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest kraft darwin binary for your architecture from:
https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/releases/latest

Extract the archive to a local directory. For example:

```
tar -xvf kraftkit_0.6.6_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

Then install the following dependencies for `kraft`:

```
brew install gnu-sed make coreutils m4 gawk grep wget qemu socat
# ...for compiling x86_64 Unikernels (needed for KraftCloud)
brew install x86_64-elf-binutils x86_64-elf-gcc
# ...for compiling aarch-64 Unikernels
brew install aarch64-elf-binutils aarch64-elf-gcc
```

## Debian/Ubuntu

We recommend installing KraftKit using the interactive method described above.
However, if you would like to manage your installation directly, we offer APT
repositories that can be referenced to access the latest stable version of
`kraft`.  To get started, install the following preliminary tools:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

Add Unikraft’s official GPG key:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://apt.pkg.kraftkit.sh/kraftkit/linux/debian/gpg | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/unikraft.gpg
```

Use the following command to set up the APT repository:

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/unikraft.gpg] https://apt.pkg.kraftkit.sh \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unikraft.list > /dev/null
```

Update the APT package index, and install the latest version of `kraftkit`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install kraftkit
```


## Fedora/RHEL

We recommend installing KraftKit using the interactive method described above.
However, 


## Arch Linux

We recommend installing KraftKit using the interactive method described above.
However, 


## Windows

KraftKit currently does not support an installation natively on Microsoft
Windows.  However, you can use [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2
(WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) which supports both
running `kraft` as well as executing Unikraft unikernels.

To get started, please ensure that you have [WSL2 set up on your
host](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).  We recommend
using the Linux distributions Ubuntu or Debian: 

```powershell
wsl --install -d debian
```

Once complete, restart WSL either by shutting down Windows or by closing all of
your WSL terminal windows and issue this command in Powershell, CMD, or Windows
Run menu (Windows+R)

```powershell
wsl.exe --shutdown
```

### Troubleshooting

Once restarted, simply following the instructions for [installing `kraft`
for Debian/Ubuntu](#debianubuntu) from within WSL2.


Once installed, you must ensure that nested-virtualization is enabled.  This
will allow you to [run Unikraft via QEMU for KVM later](#) by editing
`/etc/wsl.conf`:

```toml
[wsl2]
nestedVirtualization=true

[boot]
command = /bin/bash -c 'chown -v root:kvm /dev/kvm && chmod 660 /dev/kvm'
```

Then add yourself to the `kvm` group:

```
sudo usermod -a -G kvm ${USER}
```

If you have experience with Hyper-V platform APIs, please consider
[contributing to Unikraft platform drivers](#) as we have [an on-going track for
this](#).  If you have experience building Go applications for Microsoft
Windows, we also have [an open issue on KraftKit to support this platform](#).
Thank you!

## Build unikernels from within a container

<Warning>
Please note that a unikernel and a container are not the same.  Read more
about [the differences between Unikraft and existing runtime systems](#).
</Warning>

You can use KraftKit inside of a container to help you build and package
unikernels.  We ship a standard build environment called "base" that includes
all the tools necessary for building Unikraft unikernrels, including the latest
version of `kraft`.


```bash
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/app kraftkit.sh/base:latest
```


## From source

To build `kraft` from source, please see our [hacking documentation](#).
