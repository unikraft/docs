  Learn how to access pre-built unikernels, Unikraft library components, or
  distribute newly constructed unikernels.
---

Package management with `kraft` is handled through the `pkg` subcommand which
offers convenient mechanisms for retrieving, packaging and distributing
components used during the formation of unikernels based on Unikraft.  `kraft
pkg` can also help retrieve or distribute completely pre-built unikernels ready
for use.

To get started building unikernels or accessing pre-built unikernels, we must
first learn how we can retrieve one or many of these components using `kraft
pkg`.


## Checking for updates

By default and when left unconfigured, `kraft` will retrieve a list of official
Unikraft library components that can be used later on [when building a
unikernel](#).  The first step is to retrieve the latest information about these
components.  Simply run:

```bash
kraft pkg update
```

<AsciinemaPlayer
   rows={8}
   src="/asciinema/kraft-pkg-update.cast"
   />

This will locally store information locally about packages and library
components.  [This location on-disk](#) and [the remote location of the
component locations](#) can be configured to yours needs.

It is recommended to regularly run `kraft pkg update` as Unikraft regularly
updates its components with new features, bug fixes, newly supported
applications, libraries, etc. [See Unikraft's release schedule](#).

<Info>
In some cases, such as with `kraft build`, updating is done implicitly before
the command's main functionality is executed.  Because of this, in some
subcommands, a `--no-update` flag is offered to prevent this operation from
occurring.
</Info>


## Package component types

Unikraft ships (and `kraft` allows you to ship) packages of different component
types.  A component is a building block, and ultimately a code base, repository
or distributable archive or binary, which is used within the Unikraft ecosystem.
Components are one of 5 unique types:

| Type   | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `core` | A repository containing the [Unikraft core codebase](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft) which consists of a Make and KConfig-based build system.  The Unikraft core provides the glue for stiching other components as well as your application together. |
| `arch` | The component that defines behavior and hardware interactions specific to the target architecture. |
| `plat` | A repository containing code that defines the interaction with the underlying hardware, depending on whether a hypervisor is present or not, and which hypervisor is present. |
| `lib`  | A repository containing a [Unikraft external library](https://unikraft.org/docs/concepts/#unikraft-libraries), that defines an user-space functionality. |
| `app`  | The final component type is that of a fully functioning unikernel.  The `app` component defines the use of the `core`, a `arch` and `plat` combination, as well as a list of `lib`s. |


## Package Managers

Internal to `kraft` are programmable package managers that allows you to fetch
resources that either comprise of library components (distributed through [the
KraftKit manifest specification](#manifest-based-packages)) of a unikernel or
fully pre-built unikernels (distributed using the [OCI Image
Specification](#oci-based-packages)).


### Manifest-based packages

A manifest-based package is a simple representation of a component that is one
of three distributable types:

- A Git repository;
- A directory; or,
- A tarball.


### OCI-based packages

It is possible to access pre-built and to distribute yourself unikernel images
using the [OCI Image
Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md).
This feature enables you to use existing registries to store and distribute
unikernel images quickly and easily.

Built in to `kraft` is a reference to our public-access OCI registry which is
hosted simply at `unikraft.org`.  To access unikernel images in another
registry, simply [add it as a source](#sourcing-additional-packages).

You can configure different backends for OCI images, the default is
directory-based and will store the artifacts locally on disk.  Alternatively,
you can use [containerd](https://https://containerd.io/) as a backend by setting
the [`containerd_addr` to the daemon socket in the global
settings](/docs/cli/options).


## Listing and searching for packages

You can list all packages and components with:

```bash
kraft pkg list
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-pkg-list.cast" />

To view the latest applications distributed as OCI images that are provided by
the Unikraft OSS Project's registry, simply run the following: 

```bash
kraft pkg ls -u --apps
```

The above command lists components by `--apps` and requests an update
(`-u|--update`) such that it queries the remote registry.


## Sourcing additional packages

<Info>
By default, you do not need to source any additional repositories or manifests
if you have a freshly installed version of `kraft` and simply wish to get
started using existing applications, libraries or the Unikraft core based on
the publicly available and official channels.
</Info>

To manage components with `kraft`, we must first know where we can find them.
This is done by "sourcing" them from a remote location with:

```bash
kraft pkg source SOURCE
```

Where `SOURCE` is, for example:

```bash
# Source a component represented as a public Git repository
kraft pkg source https://github.com/unikraft/lib-lwip.git

# Sourcing a private Git repository
kraft pkg source git@github.com:unikraft/lib-mylib.git

# Sourcing a manifest (index) of packages
kraft pkg source https://manifests.kraftkit.sh/index.yaml

# Sourcing a manifest of a single package
kraft pkg source https://manifests.kraftkit.sh/lib/lwip.yaml

# Source an OCI registry
kraft pkg source localhost:3000
```

In the above example, there are three types of sources:

1. **Git repositories representing a component**: When sourcing repositories
   directly, e.g. when you wish to use a git repository representing a
   microlibrary, `kraft pkg source` will attempt to determine the component type
   with the naming convention `$type-$name` (e.g. `lib-lwip`, `app-helloworld`).  
   
   See `kraft pkg source --help` for more information about how to correctly
   annotate sources with unconventional names. 

2. **Manifests**: It is possible to pass `kraft pkg source` a local path on disk
   or a remote URL to a [Manifest file](#Manifest-Specification) which
   represents either a list of components or a single component.

   The officially maintained manifest for all Unikraft components (and default
   manifest if KraftKit is left unconfigured) is:
   ```
   https://manifests.kraftkit.sh/index.yaml
   ```

3. **OCI Registries**: It is possible to add a reference to a remote OCI
   registry to view pre-built unikernel images. 

### Removing a source of packages

To remove a source, you can unsource it by invoking:

```
kraft pkg unsource [SOURCE]
```

Invoking `kraft pkg unsource` without the optional `[SOURCE]` positional
argument (which must be an exact match) you will be prompted to interactively
select which source(s) you would like to remove from KraftKit.


## Retrieving a package

To cache a package locally on your machine either for multiple uses or within
the context of a project's build, you can use:

```
kraft pkg pull [PACKAGE]
```

Without any flags, the above command will store a copy in [the manifest cache
directory](#).  When used with `-w`, it will save it in the context of a
project.


## Packaging your application

[Once you have successfully built a Unikraft unikernel](/docs/cli/building) and
you wish to distribute your application, you can use the top-level `kraft pkg`
subcommand.  Left without any arguments, the command will use information
supplied in the `Kraftfile` to determine how to package the artifact(s):

```bash
# Simply invoke kraft pkg within the application directory
kraft pkg

# Or pass a path to a an application directory
kraft pkg path/to/my/app
```

To package your image as an OCI image, you can force the type and OCI Image
Reference name (or tag) to be used:

```bash
kraft pkg --as oci --name unikraft.org/helloworld:latest
```

<AsciinemaPlayer
   rows={8}
   src="/asciinema/kraft-pkg-as-oci.cast" />

In the above example, [a "Hello, world!"
project](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/tree/main/examples/helloworld-c) with a single target
(`qemu/x86_64`) is packaged as an OCI image with the name
`unikraft.org/helloworld:latest`.

If your project has multiple targets, each built target will be packaged
together to produce a [multi-platform
image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/).

## Distributing your application

Once packaged, it is possible to push the resulting image to the remote
registry.  Simply invoke:

```bash
kraft pkg push unikraft.org/helloworld:latest
```
