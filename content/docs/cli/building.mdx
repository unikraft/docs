title: Building a unikernel
description: |
  Learn how to build your application into a unikernel using `kraft`.  In this
  document we outline general practices and different methods for building new
  applications from scratch or converting existing applications to a unikernel.
---

Before beginning, it's important to famliarize yourself with [the general
understanding of what a unikernel is](/docs/concepts#introduction-to-unikernels)
and [Unikraft's underlying build process](/docs/concepts/build-process). This
can help you better troubleshoot issues may run into when building your
application as a unikernel.

There are several different ways you can build a unikernel using Unikraft and
with `kraft`.  Fundementally, there are two ways in which a unikernel can be
used:

1. To compile code natively against the Unikraft library Operating System (which
   generally has better performance).  In this first scenario, the user-level
   application code is written in a compile-time language, like C, Go or Rust.

2. To use a "loader" which accepts arbirary user code or binaries which is
   executed on top of an existing, pre-built unikernel.  In this second
   scenario, either the user program is built using an interpreted language such
   as Python or JavaScript, or, it is a pre-compiled Linux userspace binary.

This document goes into detail regarding the former case: where you are
compiling your application against Unikraft.  For pre-built Linux userspace 
binaries or runtime languages such as Python or JavaScript, please [read more
about running your application as a unikernel](#).


## Initializing a project with a `Kraftfile`

The first step in preparing your application to be built or run with Unikraft is
to create a top-level `Kraftfile` in your source repository.

<Info>
See also the complete [`Kraftfile` syntax and schema information](/docs/cli/reference/kraftfile).
</Info>


## Configuring your project

[The `Kraftfile` is the static configuration
file](/docs/cli/reference/kraftfile) used to programmatically build and package
a unikernel using `kraft`.  This file contains information about the Unikraft
core build system, third-party libraries, all configuration options which are
used for the build and a list of possible targets for the application.  For all
components, you can define [KConfig options](#specifying-kconfig-configuration)
which set options and their respective values.

To discover more options or to set things graphically, you can invoke:

```bash
kraft menu
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-menu.cast" />

In the above example, the ["Hello, world!" example
application](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/tree/main/examples/helloworld-c) was configured by hand
using Unikraft's built-in [menuconfig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menuconfig)
system for `qemu/x86_64`.  Colored ANSI output and the internal test suite,
`uktest`, were selected and enabled for the build.

<Warning>
The configuration for the application is written to a new file and **not** the
original `Kraftfile`.  Instead, for `qemu/x86_64`, it is written to
`.config.helloworld_qemu-x86_64` in the project directory.  This `.config.*`
file is an intermediate file that is generated from either a `Kraftfile` or from
running `kraft menu`.  **This `.config*` file is the source-of-truth for `kraft`
in terms of build-time configuration.**
</Warning>


## Compiling and linking your application with Unikraft

Projects that are compiled against Unikraft, such as those written in C/C++, Go,
Rust, etc. must define a `Makefile.uk` which includes all relevant source files
of your application, e.g.:

```make
$(eval $(call addlib,apphelloworld))

APPHELLOWORLD_SRCS-y += $(APPHELLOWORLD_BASE)/main.c
```

Once your source files have been defined, it is simply a case of running the
following to build your project:

```bash
kraft build
```

<AsciinemaPlayer rows={14} src="/asciinema/kraft-build.cast" />

<Info title="Pro Tip">
Quickly switch between logging modes to get a better idea of what's happening
under the hood by setting the following environmental variables:
```
export KRAFTKIT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
export KRAFTKIT_LOG_TYPE=basic
```
Or by setting the equivalent command-line flags.
</Info>

```bash
kraft --log-level=debug --log-type=basic build
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-build-debug.cast" />
