title: Running unikernels locally
description: |
  Built in to `kraft` is a runtime manager which allows you to instantiate and
  manage multiple unikernel instances locally.
---

<Info>
At present, `kraft` only supports running instances that target the KVM hypervisor either through QEMU or Firecracker.
We plan on adding support for additional hypervisors including Xen, VMware and Hyper-V.  For more information the progress of these hypervisors, you can [track the relevant GitHub issue](#).

There are multiple ways to instantiate a unikernel with `kraft`.
The subcommand `kraft run` has been designed to be context-aware and can be used in different ways to launch unikernels depending on what is provided to it.

With the `kraft run` command, you are able to launch an instance using an underlying hypervisor solution.
For example, `kraft run` will interface with QEMU directly to instantiate a unikernel.

In some circumstances, for example in nested virtualization environments, it may not be possible to access hardware-level instruction sets (ISAs) to execute the unikernel.
In this scenario, hardware emulation will be used and it should be noted that this has a significant penalty on runtime performance of the application.


## Running after building a project

[Following a successful build of a unikernel](/docs/cli/building), you can simply invoke the following without any additional flags when `cd`'d within a project directory to preview the unikernel instance in action:

```console
kraft run
```

<AsciinemaPlayer rows={12} src="/asciinema/kraft-run-project.cast" />

<Warning>
For long-running applications, typing <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd> will only detach you from the application's stdout.
See more about [stopping and removing the unikernel instance](#stopping-and-removing-unikernel-instances).
</Warning>

In the above example, the [offical "Hello, world" application](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog/tree/main/examples/helloworld-c) was run.
It has multiple targets with varying platforms and architecture tuples.
When `kraft run` was invoked, it intelligently detected information about the host system and suggested two possible targets based on the availability of QEMU on the system.


## Running a Unikraft kernel binary image

It is possible to pass directly to `kraft run` in its first positional argument the path to a binary image.
In the example below, we execute a pre-built unikernel binary:

```console
kraft run KERNEL
```

<AsciinemaPlayer rows={12} src="/asciinema/kraft-run-kernel.cast" />

In the above example, the provided kernel matched the host's architecture.
`kraft` will attempt to intelligently determine whether it can run the supplied unikernel binary and select the appropriate hypervisor.


## Running a Linux userspace application (via a loader)

Given a pre-built Linux userspace application, it is possible to execute this on top of Unikraft's [ELF Loader Application](https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader) in [binary compatibility mode](/docs/concepts/compatibility).

```console
kraft run BINARY
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-run-elfloader.cast" />

In the above example, a pre-built ELF Loader application was dynamically downloaded and used to launch the pre-built `helloworld` binary.

You can set the path to the ELF Loader application, either as [an OCI Image reference](/docs/cli/packaging#oci-based-package) or to a path on disk to a kernel image via the `--elfloader` flag.
For example, we provide an `strace`-like image which is packaged as an OCI image and available publicly at `loaders.unikraft.org/strace:latest` which is useful for debugging:

```console
kraft run --elfloader loaders.unikraft.org/strace:latest BINARY
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-run-elfloader-strace.cast" />


## Running pre-built OCI-packaged images

You can reference an [OCI image unikernel](/docs/cli/packaging#oci-based-package) as a positional argument with `kraft run` which, if not present on the host machine, will be downloaded before it is executed. For example, to build an execute the official "Hello, world!" application from Unikraft, you can run:

```console
kraft run unikraft.org/helloworld:latest
```

<AsciinemaPlayer rows={12} src="/asciinema/kraft-run-oci-helloworld.cast" />


## Connecting a unikernel instance to a network

In most cases, applications are intended to be accessible over a network.
Built-in to `kraft` is a network manager which allows you to create, modify and remove networks of varying implementation types.

<Info>
At present, `kraft` only supports networks on Linux based on bridge networking.
</Info>

To view existing networks, simply run:

```console
kraft net ls
```

<AsciinemaPlayer rows={10} src="/asciinema/kraft-net-ls.cast" />

To create a new network, specify the address and range in CIDR notation with the `-n` flag and a first positional argument representing the new network name:

```console
kraft net create -n 172.88.0.1/24 kraft0
```

The first address in the CIDR network will become the gateway.
Once a network has been identified, you can attach this network to the unikernel instance with the `-n|--network` flag:

```console
kraft run --network bridge:kraft0 unikraft.org/nginx:1.25
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-run-network.cast" />

In the above command, the `--network` flag requires both the underlying driver implementation name, `driver`, as well as the name of the network supported by the driver, in this case `kraft0`, separated by a colon `:`.


## Forwarding exposed ports to your host

Whilst `-n|--network` allows you to connect multiple unikernels to the same network, it can be also useful to simply port-forward from your host to a unikernel instance.

For example, when an NGINX unikernel exposes port `80` and you wish to map port `8080` on your localhost.
You can use the `-p` flag to achieve this affect as follows:

```console
kraft run -p 8080:80 unikraft.org/nginx:1.25
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="/asciinema/kraft-run-port.cast" />

In the above example, the NGINX instance will be available at http://localhost:8080/.

## Rootfs and mounting volumes

Learn more about mounting filesystems to the unikernel instance in our [related rootfs documentation](/docs/cli/filesystem).


## Supplying command-line arguments

The unikernel instance essentially has two types of command-lines:

1. Arguments which are supplied directly to Unikraft's core.
   These manipulate Unikraft itself and are used by kernel subsystems.
   For example, these include: environmental variables; statically defined networking parameters such as IP address and gateway; and, named volumes and their intended mount paths.
2. Application-level command line arguments.
   These are intended for the application which is built as a unikernel, for example with NGINX this could be the `-c` flag which sets the path in the root filesystem to the configuration file.

To set command-line arguments for either Unikraft or the application is done as the second positional argument to `kraft run` or via the `-a` flag:

```console
kraft run unikraft.org/nginx:1.25 -c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```

To set command-line arguments for Unikraft, you simply need to separate with two dashes as a delimeter `--`, for example:

```console
kraft run unikraft.org/nginx:1.25 netdev.ipv4_addr=172.88.0.2 -- -c /nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```


## Viewing unikernel instances

To view the state of previously instantiated unikernel instances you can use the following:

```console
kraft ps
```

```text nocopy=true
NAME                KERNEL                           ARGS  CREATED      STATUS   MEM  PLAT
beautiful_bintijua  project://helloworld                   1 hour ago   exited   64M  qemu/x86_64
elastic_guy         oci://unikraft.org/nginx:1.25        2 hours ago  running  64M  qemu/x86_64
```

The above command will display a `ps`-like output which displays the name, the "source" of the unikernel (whether from [a project context](#running-after-building-a-project), a [binary context](#running-a-unikraft-kernel-binary-image), an [ELF Loader context](#running-a-linux-userspace-application-via-a-loader) or an [OCI image context](#running-pre-built-oci-packaged-images)), any command-line arguments supplied to it, when it was created, its state, how much memory was assigned to the instance, and which platform/architecture it is.

To view more detailed information about all instances, supply the `--long` flag:

```console
kraft ps --long
```

Possible states of a unikernel instance are:

| State        | Description                                                       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unknown`    | The instance's state could not be determined.                     |
| `created`    | The instance has been created but not started.                    |
| `failed`     | The instance could not be created.                                |
| `restarting` | The instance is in the process of rebooting.                      |
| `running`    | The instance is active and executing.                             |
| `paused`     | The instance has been paused and is no longer executing.          |
| `exited`     | The instance has gracefully exited (whether successful or not.)   |
| `errored`    | The instance has non-gracefully exited, e.g. crashed or panicked. |


## Stopping and removing unikernel instances

To stop an instance that is actively executing, you simply need to reference its name which was either automatically generated or set via the `-n|--name` flag:

```console
kraft stop NAME
```

To stop all actively executing instances, you can simply pass the `--all` flag:

```console
kraft stop --all
```

To remove a specific instance:

```console
kraft rm NAME
```

And to remove all instances, similarly pass the `--all` flag:

```console
kraft rm --all
```

<Info>
Running `kraft rm` will gracefully stop the unikernel instance(s) before it is
removed.
